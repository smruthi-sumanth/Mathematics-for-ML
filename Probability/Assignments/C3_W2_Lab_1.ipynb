    "In this notebook, you will be working with two distinct datasets. You will notice that relying solely on the main statistical measures such as mean, variance (or standard deviation), and correlation may not always effectively describe the datasets. Therefore, it is always advisable to supplement these measures with visualization techniques and/or other statistical measures to gain a deeper understanding of the data.\n",

These datasets are artificially generated and are used to illustrate the fact that some metrics can fail to capture important information present in a dataset. More specifically, these datasets are used to demonstrate how relying solely on metrics can sometimes be misleading. If you're interested, you can read more about Anscombe's quartet and the Datasaurus Dozen dataset at their respective [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet) page and [Autodesk Research](https://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/research/publications-assets/pdf/same-stats-different-graphs.pdf) article."

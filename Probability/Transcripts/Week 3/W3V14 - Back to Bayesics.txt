So let's go back to our example where we
had some evidence which was popcorn in the floor and three possible scenarios. And we're trying to investigate
which scenario happened. The first one is movies, which creates
the popcorn with a high probability. The second one is board games, which
creates popcorn with a medium probability. And the third one is a nap that creates
popcorn with a very low probability. So we went for movies, which is the one that generated
the evidence with the highest probability. But however, that's not the whole story. Imagine that now we have
two different candidates. One is that we were watching movies, and the other one that there was
a popcorn throwing contest. So movies create popcorn in the floor with
high probability, but a popcorn throwing contest would create popcorn in the floor
with a very, very, very high probability. It's almost for sure that if you
have a popcorn throwing contest, that you ended up with
popcorn in the floor. So that's the winner. However, something tells us that movies
should be the winner and not popcorn, why? Well, one reason is that it's likely that
you could have been watching movies. A popcorn throwing contest
is not very likely. It's a very unlikely event. So even though it's more likely
to have generated the evidence, it's less likely to have happened
on its own, and that should matter. And that should mean that
we want to pick movies. But let's put some math here,
before what we did is maximize the probability
P(popcorn/scenario). So we figure out that P(popcorn/movies)
was higher than P(popcorn/contest). However, the probability that you're
watching a movie by itself is actually higher than the probability that
there was a popcorn contest. It's actually much higher. And so
we should factor this into the equation. So we should actually multiply them. And when we have the product, then the
inequality goes in the other direction. And it turns out that it's more
likely to have watched a movie. Now, notice that this looks familiar. P(popcorn/movies)P(movies) resembles
P(A/B)P(B), which, as we know,
is the probability of A intersection B, the probability of A and
B happening at the same time. So therefore, we're trying to maximize
the probability that there's popcorn and a movie and the probability that
there's popcorn and a contest. That's really what we care about. And that makes more sense because that's
actually what we want to maximize. Not just a conditional probability, but we want to maximize the probability
that those two things happen. Now, what does this have
to do with regularization? Let me tell you in the next video.

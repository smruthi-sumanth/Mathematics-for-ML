Recall from Week 2 that the
variance is a measure of how much the values in a dataset
deviate from the mean. Using a dataset of
five to represent heights of people as shown
here by these five dots, the mean is 160. This dataset has
a large variance. Now, this dataset over here has a smaller variance because
it has a smaller spread, the points deviate
less from the mean. The top dataset has
a small variance and the bottom dataset
has a large variance. Recall that the variance
is Sigma squared, which is the average
over the population size of x minus the population
mean Mu squared. Now the question is, how do we estimate the population
variance with a sample? Estimating a mean
is easy because you take a sample and
estimate the mean, but estimating the variable
can be a little harder. Let's start with a
very simple case of a three-sided dice. Imagine that we have
a three-sided dice, and the possible outcomes
are one, two, three. The population mean Mu
is going to be 1+2+3/3, which is 6/3, which is two. Using the formula for
the population variance, let's find x Mu for
each of the values one, two, three, and then square it. This will be the following. Since Mu is two, we're going to look at x-2. We have 1-2, 2-2, and 3-2. Now we square them. This is one, zero, and one. Now we add them. The sum is two. Since we're taking the average,
we're dividing by three. The population variance is 2/3. This is the variance
of the entire dataset. But now let's try
to estimate it. Let's say that we
don't want to take all the samples because
let's say there's too many. We're going to flip this
three-sided dice twice and then look at the outcomes as a sample to estimate
their variance. Let's say that we have all these possible outcomes
and we're going to calculate the sample variance of each of these samples
using this formula. Then average all those variances and see if we get
a good estimate for the population variance
right here, this 2/3. Let's take the variance of
each one of these samples. Before calculating the variance, we need to find the
mean of everyone in the samples and they
are calculated here. Now, let's go for the variance. The variance is the
summation of x minus the mean of the sample squared divided by
n, which is two. These are these
numbers over here. We're expecting that
to be an estimate of the population variance. What's the average of
all of these numbers? Is 0.333, which is 1/3. However, that's not
what we wanted. We wanted to estimate
a 2/3 and we got 1/3. We must have done
something wrong. What did we do wrong? Turns out that we don't
have to divide by n. We have to divide
by n-1 minus instead. If we divide by n-1, we get the right estimate. If we estimate the
variance of each of these samples of length 2. But instead of dividing by n, which is two, we divide by n-1, which is one, then we
get these numbers. When we average
these numbers out, we get the actual estimated
variance, which is 2/3. In other words, when you want to take a sample
of the variance, you don't divide by the
size of the sample, you divide by the size
of the sample minus one. On the left, you have
the population variance, which is the average of all the squares of the
distances from the mean, but when you want to estimate this variance by
taking a sample, you don't divide by n, you divide by n-1, and that gives you
a better estimate. Let's take the example of
throwing a four-sided dice. The possible outcomes are
one, two, three, and four, and the population
mean is the average of these, which is 2.5. Now let's calculate the
population variance. The population variance
is given by this formula. Let's look at all the x's. Then x-Mu takes these
values, this -2.5. Let's square them and take
the average of these numbers. We get five, which divided
by n is going to be 5/4. That's the population variance. Now, let's take
samples of length 2. We're going to
take all the pairs of values we obtained by
throwing the dice twice. Now let's look at all the
means for these samples, and the goal is to estimate this Sigma square over here.
How do we estimate it? Let's take the variance
of each one of these samples using the
formula variance of x equals summation of x-x
bar squared divided by n. These are
all our variances. When we take the
average of these ones, it's 5/8, which is not
the 5/4 we wanted. That's because we
divide it by n. But if we divide by n-1 instead, then here are the variances and the average of these
ones is actually 5/4, which is what we wanted. This is another example of how when we want to
estimate the variance, we divide by n-1 and not by n.

Let's say you have the entire world population and you're looking at
everyone's height. If you want to find the average height of the population or at
least estimate it, you can take a small
sample of the population, calculate the average
of the heights here and that's an estimate for the average of the height
of the total population. You can do this with other
things such as proportions. However, when you try to do it with the variance,
something fails. If I take a small
sample of the dataset, calculate the variance here, I don't get the variance of the original dataset but I
do get something very close. Let me show you. Let's revisit the Island of
Statistopia again and for simplicity assume that
the population size is 10 as shown here, and the heights are
shown over here. Now, what is the average
height in Statistopia? We can calculate it like this
very easily and get 160 cm. That is the population mean and we're going
to call it Mu. That Mu lies over here. Now, what if for some
reason you can't record all the 10
people's heights? As a result, you're only
able to get six people, and you did so randomly. Let's say that your
sample size was six. Now, what is the estimate for the average height
in Statistopia? Well, if you pick
this six people, then it's going to be 160.97. That is a sample mean which
you're going to call X-bar. Because it's the first
sample we're taking, let's label this X-bar, but actually
underscored with a one. X_1 bar is our first estimate. Now let's take another sample of six people and let's
calculate their heights. This one is going to
be 156 centimeters so we're going to call that X_2 bar and that's
going to go here. Now let's compare
X_1 bar and X_2 bar. Both of these have a
sample size of six but which one is the better estimate
for the population mean? Well, X_1 is better
and this can be attributed to the fact that
we did more random sampling. As you can see, the
second set is formed by the six shortest people so
it's not a good sample. But what if instead of
n=6, we picked n=2? What is the estimated
average height in Statistopia using n=2? Well, let's pick two random
people and we get 158 cm. That's going to be
called X_3 bar. As you can imagine, X_1 bar is a better estimate
than X_3 bar, because X_1 bar use six people
and X_3 bar only use two. We're going to explore
this phenomenon in more detail in
the later lessons. But for now, it's good to know that the bigger
the sample size, the better the estimate
you're going to get from your sample of
the population mean.

Hello and welcome back to Course 3 of the Math for Machine Learning and Data
Science Specialization. This is the first lesson in the third week of the Probability
and Statistics course. We're going to be focusing on statistics for the second
half of the course. To get us started, we're
going to talk about two key concepts that are essential to
understanding statistics; the concept of a population
and the concept of a sample. A population is the entire group of individuals or items
that we want to study. A sample is a smaller subset that we actually
observe or measure. For example, if I'm trying to measure the height
of all the humans, well, all the humans
are the population, but obviously, I'm not
going to measure everybody. I'm going to take a
sample of 100 of them, for example, that's our sample. In machine learning
and data science, we often use samples to
train models and make predictions because we can't look at the entire
universe of data. It's important to understand
the difference between the two and how they're
relevant to the work we do. Let's dive in and
explore these together. Welcome to the beautiful
island of Statistopia, where you've been hired as
a data scientist to help them with all their
statistics problems. The first task is to find the average height of the
people living in Statistopia. You're saying to yourself,
easy peasy lemon squeezy, I know how to
calculate averages. I'm going to ask everyone on
the island for their height and then divide by the
total number of people. You check how many people
live on the island and you're told that
it's 10,000 people. That's a lot of people. Not so easy peasy
lemon squeezy anymore. How do you calculate the average of the heights
if there are so many people? You have to change strategies
and only ask a few people living on the island in order
to estimate the average. All the subjects of
interest in the study, the people living in Statistopia,
are your population. If you randomly select a
subset of the population, say of size 100, then that subset is the sample. In this example, the
population size is 10,000, denoted by N, and the sample size could
be anything smaller, from 1-9,999, that's denoted by n. We're going to try to pick a number that is small
enough to be manageable, but also large enough
to be significant. For simplicity and
illustration's sake, let's assume that there's only
10 people on Statistopia, meaning the population
size is 10. Now, you want to take
four for your study. Let me show you
two ways to do it. The first one is to pick
four random people, and the second one is to put them on a line from shorter to taller and pick the
first four people. Which one do you think is good and which one
do you think is bad? If you thought that the
first one was better, that is correct because you always want to take
random samples. The second way to do it
would probably get you a smaller average because you're taking the shorter
people in the line. Now, let me show you
another example. Let's say you pick
four random people. Let's say you want to run
the experiment again, so you take another four people. Well, that's not good. Why not? Because you took the
first sample set at random. But the second one depends on the first one because you
couldn't repeat the people, and that's not good. You can't do it. Why is the sample, set
two, not a good sample? Because it is dependent
on the first one. You have to start
all over every time. People are allowed to be repeated and that
is very important. Otherwise, the second
sample set depends on the first one and that
ruins your experiment. Another thing that you
need to make sure is that the samples are
identically distributed. Whatever rule you use to pick
the first one needs to be the same rule you use
to pick the second one. If you were to go to
a particular part of town where people are
taller or shorter, then you're not going
to get a good sample. You have to make sure
your samples are all independent and
identically distributed. Let's test your
knowledge of populations and samples with this example. The example is the
avocado toast trend. A popular trend that
involves spreading mashed or sliced avocados
on top of your toast. Trends can have a
significant impact on the economic value of goods. After the avocado toast trend, you decide to study the
price of avocados in the US. You simply can't check
every single purchase of avocados in the US, so you randomly pick four stores and record the prices
for each avocado sale. What do you think is the
population in this example? The population of the study is all the avocados sold in the US. Now, what is the sample? The sample is the avocados sold by the four
stores you selected. All right, so let's check
some implications of populations and samples
in machine learning. In machine learning, every
data set you work with is actually a sample
and not the population, no matter how big
the data set is. For example, when working with classification of
cat images from all the infinite possible
images of cats and not cats, your data set is
simply a sample. It is important to have
a representative data set though as you also saw
in the height example, in the population
of Statistopia. Having a representative data set means the distribution of your data set is the same as
the one for the population. For example, if you're working in a classification model for cats and all your cat
photos are cats and grass, then when you show a cow standing in the grass
it might learn to say it's a cat because it learns to associate
it with grass, or if you see a cat on a couch, it won't recognize it because
it doesn't see grass. It's essential to
have a variety of cat images and a variety
of non-cat images. Now let's end the
session with a recap of the formal definitions of
the terms you have learned. Population is the entire
set of individuals or elements that you want to study that share
common behavior. A sample is a subset
of the population that you use to draw conclusions about the population as a whole. N is used to denote
population sign, and n is used to denote
the sample size.

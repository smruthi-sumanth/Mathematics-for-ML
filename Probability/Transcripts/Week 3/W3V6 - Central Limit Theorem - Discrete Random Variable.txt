Remember I told you before that the normal distribution
appears in a lot of places. Here's one that perhaps
you didn't expect. Take a distribution,
any distribution, it can be as skewed as you want. Now, take a few samples, always the same number, and look at the average, and do this many times and
plot all these average. Guess what you get? Yes, you get the normal distribution no matter what distribution you started with in the first place. This is a fascinating result and is one of the
pinnacles of statistics, is called the Central
Limit Theorem. Let's start with an example of a discrete random
variable that you've seen a lot of time
in this course. The probability of heads
and tails is the same, and the random variable
X is the number of heads when a coin is
flipped and times. So it's X=1 for
the case of heads, and X=0 for the case of tails, and that's a discrete
random variable with this probability
distribution over here. A 1/2 for X=1 and 1/2 for X=0, where the number of heads is in the horizontal axis and the probability is in
the vertical axis. Now what can we say about the probability
distribution when the number of coin
flips increases? Well, here's what
happens with two coins. Here's what happens
with three coins, with four and this is with 10. As you can see, this looks a lot like a Gaussian
or normal distribution. This is an example
of the central limit theorem that says that as you increase the
number of observations, your distribution looks more and more like the Gaussian
distribution. Now, recall that in here, when we're tossing n coins
with a probability of p, then the mean Mu is np, which is n times the
probability of heads, and the variance is np*1-p, which is n, times probability of heads times
probability of tails. For the case n=1, we have that the mean is n*p, which is 1*0.5, and that's 0.5. That's the case when
we have a fair coin, and the standard deviation
is n*p*1-p which is 0.25. Let's calculate the mean
and standard deviation for all these examples. For the first one, we
have 0.5 and 0.25. For the second one,
it's one and 0.5. For the third one
is 1.5 and 0.75, then 2 and 1, and for the 10th
one is 5 and 2.5. Now, what are these numbers? Well, has n becomes
sufficiently large, we get a normal distribution
where the mean is np and the standard deviation is
np*1-p just as expected.

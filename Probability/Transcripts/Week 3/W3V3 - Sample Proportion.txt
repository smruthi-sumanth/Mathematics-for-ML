So, once again, for illustration sake, imagine that there's only ten
people living in Statistopia. That means you have
a population size of 10. Now, everybody has some form of
transportation as shown, either a car or bicycle. Now, what proportion of
the people own a bicycle? Well, to answer this question, we first
need to identify everyone with a bicycle, those are highlighted here, and we'll
divide by the total number of people. So, that's 4 divided by 10, or 40%. 40% is the proportion of
the population that own a bicycle. And of course, this is assuming that everybody
owns exactly one type of vehicle. This metric right here is called
the population proportion, noted by p. And the population proportion is
the number of items with a given characteristic, x,
divided by the population n. Now, what if you don't have access
to the population size of 10 and you have to do it with
randomly sampled data? So we're going to take a random
sample of 6 people and let's calculate the proportion here. What proportion of people own a bike? Well, here it's going to be
2 divided by 6, so 33.3%. This metric is the sample
proportion denoted by p hat. And notice that the sample
proportion is some estimate of the population proportion p.

Now let's look at
a similar problem. Let's say that you have some observations and they
are the numbers 1 and -1. This observation were sampled
from some distribution, and the question is, what distribution could they
have been sampled from? Well, let's say we
have two candidates. In normal distribution with mean 10 and standard
deviation 1, and a normal
distribution with mean 2 and standard deviation 1. The question is, which one
of these two do you think is more likely to have
generated the observations? Well, let's take a look. Here we have the two
observations 1 and -1, and let's put them over
here in the graph. Now let's look at the heights at those
points of the curve. The heights on top are very low, and the ones at the bottom
are a little higher. Now, it turns out that these
heights are probabilities. Well, not exactly,
they're likelihoods. You can see that
the bottom curve, the one with mean 2 produces both points with
a higher likelihood. Therefore, this
one is the winner. So we're going to pick this
one among the two candidates. The top one generates data
with very low likelihood, whereas the bottom one generates it with much higher likelihood. We conclude that
among these two, it's the bottom Gaussian, the one with mean 2 and
standard deviation 1, the one that probably
generated them. I'm going to look
at three Gaussians, the one with mean -1 and
standard deviation 1, the one with mean 0, standard deviation 1, and the one with mean 1
and standard deviation 1. Here are the three plots. Now let's test your intuition. Which one of these
three do you think generated those two points? Well, let's take a look
at the likelihoods. Or first let's take a
look at the Gaussians. The first one has a Mu of -1, the second a Mu of 0, and the third one, a Mu of 1. Now, let's see
which one was more likely to have generated
these three points. Let's actually plot
the likelihoods. The likelihoods are
these vertical bars that go from the
point to the curve, and on the top one, the heights are 0.399 and 0.054. For the middle one,
they're both 0.242, and for the bottom one
they're 0.054 and 0.399. Now the question is, which one
of these three do we pick? Well, if they were
probabilities, we wouldn't multiply
them because these two points are
independently generated. So because they're likelihoods, let's also multiply them. Let's take the product
of these two numbers, 0.022, then the product
of these two numbers, and the product of
these two numbers. Which one is higher? The higher one is the one in
the middle, which is 0.059. So we conclude that
among these three, the Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard
deviation 1 is more likely. This one generated the data with a higher likelihood
than the other two, so that's the one that wins. Notice one more thing. The mean for the
first one is -1, the mean for the
second one is 0, and the mean for
the third one is 1. Now, what is the mean for
the original dataset, the dataset that was
generated? It's 0. It's the same one as the
one of the winning curve, and the reason is that
the best distribution is the one where the mean of the distribution is the
mean of the sample. Now let's go back to
our two observations, and now that we've
established that the best distribution
has to have mean 0, then let's look at several
distributions with mean 0. The first one has a
standard deviation of 0.5, the second one a
standard deviation of 1, and the third one
standard deviation of 2, and this is how they look. These are their means and
their standard deviations, and recall that all of
them have a mean of 0 and standard deviation
of 0.5, 1 and 2. Now here's a question
to test your intuition. Which one of those
three do you think was more likely to have generated
the points 1 and -1? Well, let's do the
same thing again. Let's plot the points
over here and draw all these heights
which are likelihoods, and we're going to
look at the product of the likelihoods and
see which one wins. This one over here on top
has heights of 0.044, the second one has
heights of 0.242, and the third one
has height of 0.176. When we multiply them, the highest product is
the one in the middle, which is 0.059, and
that's the best one. So the Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and
standard deviation 1 is the most likely want to
have generated that data. Among the three, is the one that gives the
data the highest likelihood. Now, notice something
else that's interesting. What is the variance
of the observations? So the variance of the
observations is calculated as the average of the squares of the distances from the mean, and that is going to be 1. Now, what is the variance of each one of the
distributions? Well, the top one
has variance 0.5^2, the second 1, and the third 2^2.

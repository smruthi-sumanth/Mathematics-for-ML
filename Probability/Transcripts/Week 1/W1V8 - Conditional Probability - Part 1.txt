Welcome back. You've
seen a lot of fascinating concepts
of probability so far. In this lesson, we
will take a look at the concept of
conditional probability. Conditional probability is all about calculating
the probability of an event happening given that another event
has already happened. For example, let's say you are wondering about the probability
that today is humid, that is some number. However, if you found out
that yesterday was raining, the probability that
today is humid changes, that is a conditional
probability. In a previous lesson, we
established the probability of obtaining two heads when you
throw two coins as follows. Let me recap very quickly. The first head can
be heads or tails, and for each option
of these two, the second one can
be heads or tails, so we have four
possibilities: Head heads, head tails, tail heads
and tails tails. The probability of
heads heads, well, the sample space was of size 4 and the event was of size 1, so it was 1/4. Now let me ask you a question. What is the probability
that both coins land on heads if you know that the
first one landed in heads? Now you have more information. I came and told you that the
first coin landed in heads. Now, what is the probability that both of them
landed in heads? Well, if the first
one landed in heads, then we live here. This is a new sample space. The bottom part
doesn't count anymore because the first coin landed
in heads and not tails. Now the denominator is
not four, but it's two, because now there's
two cases instead of four and we still have
one favorable outcome, so the new answer is 1/2. This over here is called a conditional probability and we denote it with a vertical bar. The probability of heads heads, given that the first is heads. That given that is denoted
by a vertical bar, and this is a
conditional probability. This can be seen in
a table as follows. If the first coin is on the left and the
second coin is on top, then these are the
four possibilities. Heads heads, heads tails, tails heads and tails tails. We're going to look
at the probability of landing our heads twice, given that the
first one is heads. We live in this first row. When we live in the first row, our sample space now has size
2 and our event has size 1. Therefore, the probability is not 1/4 anymore, is now 1/2. Now, let me ask you
another question. What is the probability
of landing in heads twice given that the first
coin landed in tails? Slightly different
question, give it a try. Well, if the first coin landed in tails, now
we're live here. This is our sample
space and the top is not valid anymore. The denominator is now two, but the numerator is zero because now there's
no heads heads, so the answer is
0/2, which is zero. This makes sense, because if one of them landed in tails, there's no way that they're
both going to land in heads. This condition really
changed the probability from 1/4 all the way to zero. Again, we can see it as
a table where we have the four cases and we want to calculate
the probability of landing in heads twice, given that the
first one is tails, means we live in the second
row, not in the first one. Well in the bottom we have
a sample space of size 2, but on the top we have nothing because
there's no heads heads in the sample space and
therefore the number is zero. As you can see, condition can change the
probability of an event, and this is what we study
with conditional probability. Let's recall the product
rule for independent events. It said that the probability of A intersection B is P(A) *P(B). But this only happen when
A and B were independent. That doesn't always happen. Let me give you an example
of something where the events are not independent. Let me
ask you a question. What is the probability
if I roll two dice that the first one lands on six
and that the sum is 10. Well, we have a space of 36 possibilities because
it's pairs of numbers. The only favorable one is 6, 4, because if the first one
is six and the sum is 10, the second one has to be four. The probability is 1/36
total ones and that's 1/36. Now, let's look at in a
slightly different way. Let's try to apply
the product rule. We want the probability
that the first one is six and that the sum is 10. We would like to have the probability that
the first one is six. Well, that is over here, so that is 6/36. Now what I have to
multiply this to obtain the probability that the first
is six and the sum is 10? Well, I need the probability
that the sum is 10, but among the ones for
which the first is six. That is this event over here, this 6,4 divided by the six, where the first one is six, and that is 1/36, which is what we obtained
here previously. To summarize, we have that the probability of
A intersection B, notice that the first is
six and that the sum is 10, is the probability of the
first one that the first is six times the probability of the second one
given the first one. We need that given
the first one. Because we need to multiply by the probability
that the sum is 10, given that the first is six. We get a slightly
different formula. Probability of A intersection
B is the probability of A times the probability
of B given A. Now, when they're independent, then probability of B given A is the same as
probability of B because A doesn't make any difference
on the occurrence of B. When they're independent, it actually translates
to B(A)*P(B). But in the general
case, is P(A)*P(B|A). That is the general product
rule that works every time. That means when the events are independent and when
they're not independent. Now let's look at
the dice example. Here's a question that
you've seen before. What is the probability that
the sum of two dice that I throw randomly is 10? Well, there's three cases divided by the total 36 of them. The answer is 3/36, which in lowest
terms, it's 1/12. Now, let's put a condition. I'm telling you that I looked at the first one and
the first one is a six. What is the probability
that now the sum is 10, given that the first one is six? Well, let's calculate it. Because the first one is six, now we live on this bottom row. The top five rows don't
matter anymore because our new sample space is
just this bottom row. Among this bottom row, well, there's six cases and one
of them is favorable, so the probability is now 1/6. The probability change
from 1/12 to 1/6. Now let's look at
another problem. What is the probability
that the sum is 10. But now the condition is that
the first one was a one. I looked and the
first one was a one. Now, what is the probability
that the sum of them is 10? Well, if the first one is a one, then now we live on this row
over here, the first one. On this row, there's six
elements and none of them satisfy that the sum is 10, because the ones
where the sum is 10 are on the very bottom. Therefore, the probability
is zero. It makes sense. If the first one is a one, there's no way I can
add a 10 because the second one can
at most be a six, so this probably
changed to zero.

Let's start with one of
the simplest distributions out there, the
binomial distribution. I like to imagine it
with coin tosses. Let's say I toss
a coin 10 times. How many heads can I obtain? Well, it could be 0, 1, 2, 3, all the way up to 10. Each one comes with its own
corresponding probability, so we draw the histogram
of probabilities, and that's the
binomial distribution. The binomial distribution
is an example of a discrete distributions, which are the simplest
ones that we'll see first. Later in the course, we'll learn the continuous ones too. But let's get to the
binomial distribution now. What is the
probability to obtain two heads when you
flip five coins? For each flip, there's a 1/2 chance to get
heads or tails. If you multiply these
together, you get 1/32, which is the probability
of this specific outcome. But there are more ways to
obtain two heads out of five, for example, this one here. This one has exactly
the same probability to be obtained as
the one on top. It turns out that
there are actually 10 possibilities to get
two heads out of five. If you look at the ways you can order two heads
and three tails, you will see that there are
actually 10 ways to do that. Each of these sequences
of heads and tails has the same probability; 1/32. Now, there are some
general way to find the number of
possible combinations. This is just ordering a sequence on two heads and three tails. Five factorial is the number of ways you can order five coins. But this is over kill because these five coins
have repeated numbers, so you need to account for that. Divide five factorial
by two factorial to remove all the cases
where you have simply swapped the two heads, and now also divide it
by three factorial to remove all the cases
where you have simply swapped the three tails. This is called the
binomial coefficient, and it counts the
number of ways you can order two heads and three tails. In general, the coefficient
n choose k counts all the combinations
in which you can have k heads in n coin tosses. One common property is
that n choose k is the same as n choose n-k. The reason for this
is because obtaining k heads is the same thing
as obtaining n-k tails. This is why the PMF of a fair coin has a
symmetrical shape. Now, can you find a
general way to write the PMF for the number of
heads in five coin tosses? Well, for more generality, suppose that the
probability of heads is p. Consider the event, X= x, where X is a random variable, and x is the number of
heads in five tosses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. What is the probability
of this event? Well, you will need
to have x heads, so that's probability p^x. This is a probability of
one particular order. The remaining 5-x tails
are probability (1-p)^5-x. However, this is just
the probability for one particular ordering, so you need to take into account
all the possible orders, which is 5 choose x. You're missing just one thing. This expression is, of course, valid for x= 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 since you can't have more than five heads
in five coin flips. This is the PMF for x, and we say that x follows
a binomial distribution. We denote it as
binomial of 5 and p, where 5 is the
number of flips and p is the probability of heads. In general, this tilde symbol
means that the variable X follows the distribution to
the right of the expression. If p is 0.5 and n = 5, then you get the following PMF. Remember that here,
you're flipping five coins and the
probability of heads is 1/2. The graph is here. Notice that since p is 1/2, then the PMF is symmetrical. In the case where we
have a different p, so we have a biased
coin, for example, p= 0.3, then you have greater chances of seeing
a small number of heads, and this is reflected
in the PMF. Now, in the example, you
were tossing five coins, but if you were tossing the
coin any number of times, then the model
should be the same. You're simply
changing a parameter. In the case that
we tossed n coins, then we have a PDF like this, where the probability
mass function is n choose x, p^x(1-p)^n-x. We call that
binomial of n and p, where n and p are the parameters of the binomial distribution, n is the number of tosses, and p is the probability
of obtaining heads. Now, try to answer
this question. What is the probability
of throwing a dice five times and
getting three ones? The order doesn't matter. Well, when you throw a dice, you can get a one or not a one, which is not that
different from a coin. In a coin, you can
get heads or tails, and you can think of the die as a biased coin where you get
heads if you throw a one, and tails if you
throw anything else, so it's a biased coin. Now, for a dice, the probability of
each value is 1/6. Now, this coin will have a
probability of heads of 1/6, and tails of 5/6, because that's all
the remaining values. You can draw a similar
histogram like before for a different p, but the same n. This time
you have n= 5, and p= 1/6. In other words, we
can look at a dice as a biased coin for
this experiment. Now, let's look at another case. Let's throw the dice 10 times, and just like before we
record the number of 1s. Is again a binomial
probability distribution. Can you tell me what are the parameters of
this distribution? Well, the above problem
can be represented with a binomial distribution
where n= 10, and 10 represents the
number of dice throws, and p represents the
probability of obtaining a 1, and that is 1/6. Therefore, the parameters
are 10 and 0.1666

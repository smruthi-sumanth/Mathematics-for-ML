Now let's look at some formulas. So remember that we're trying to find
out the probability that you're sick, given that you tested sick. And here's all the information
that we had before. So we're going to look at the people who
were actually sick and diagnosed sick, because one, the probability that you're
sick, given that you tested sick. So what's the probability that you're
sick, given that you were diagnosed sick? Well, given the fact that there's
a million people, one out of every 10,000 is sick, then the probability of being
sick is 1 divided by 10,000, that's 0.01%. That's a very,
very small sector of the population. And that's the key of this problem,
that not many people are sick, more people are misdiagnosed
than the people that are sick. So what's the probability
of not being sick? Well, it's 100% minus this, so 99.99,
that's the probability of being healthy. Now let's throw in the test. The test is 99% effective both for
sick and for healthy people. So the probability that you are diagnosed
sick, given that you're sick, is 99% because that's the probability
of a correct diagnosis. And 100 minus that is the probability
that you're diagnosed sick, given that you're not sick. That's the probability of a misdiagnosis,
so that's 1%. Now we want to find the probability that
you're sick, given that you diagnose sick. So we need to do some math. Let's use some variables. A is sick and B is diagnosed sick. So what we want is
the property of A given B. Now, from the conditional
probability formula P (A), given B times P (B) is P (A),
intersection B. So if we divide by P (B), we get that P (A) given B is P
(A) intersection B divided P (B). Let's remember what things are. P (A) given B is P of sick and diagnosed
sick divided by P of diagnose sick. Let's remember this. Now we want to find P of sick and
diagnose sick, and we also want to find
P of diagnose sick. And we're going to use Bayes theorem. So how do we find these two expressions,
the top one and the bottom one? Well, let's look at conditional
probability again, probability of A and B is probability of A times
probability of B given A. So the probability of sick and diagnosed sick is going to be
the probability that you're sick times the conditional probability that you're
diagnosed sick given that you're sick. That's simply the conditional
probability formula. So that's what's going to go on the top. Now what's going to go on the bottom
is a little more complicated, but not that much. Let's go back to the tree
of possibilities. We have this one over here which is
probability of sick and diagnosed sick. This one over here is
the product of these two, that's exactly the conditional
probability formula. So therefore,
when we try to find P of diagnosed sick, we have to look at this group over here. Notice that the people that
are diagnosed sick belong to two groups, the ones that were sick and
correctly diagnosed sick or the ones that were healthy and
misdiagnosed as sick. And this is the formula for the union, because the people that are diagnosed sick
are the union of those that are sick and diagnosed sick and
those that are healthy and diagnosed sick. And because these groups are disjoint
because you can't be sick and not sick, then the probabilities are going to add. So the probability of being diagnosed
sick is the sum of these two things and that goes in the denominator. And now all we have to do is apply
the conditional rule one more time. Probability of sick and diagnose sick
is probability of A intersection B. We can use this formula over here,
which actually gives us exactly this thing over here, which is P of sick
times P of diagnose sick given sick. Now we can do the exact same thing for
P of not sick and diagnose sick. That's also an intersection, it's just
a prime intersection B, and that's probability of not sick times, probability
of diagnosed sick given not sick. So those things can go in the denominator
and that's exactly Bayes theorem. Now when we plug in the numbers,
what do we get? This is .01%, this is 99%, this over here is 99.99%, and this is 1%. So What do we get here? Well, it's going to be
the following numbers. This over here is P (A),
this is P (A) prime, this is P (B) given A, and
this is P (B) given A prime. And those go over here in the formula. And now when we plug in the numbers, we get 0.0001 times 0.99 divided by 0.0001 times 0.99 + 0.9999 times 0.01. And that gives us exactly
the number that we wanted. So that formula in the middle p (A) given
B equals P (A) P (B) given A divided by P (A) P (B) given A plus P (A) prime P
(B) given A prime, that is Bayes theorem. And that may look confusing, but
don't worry, we'll see it again and it'll be very clear.

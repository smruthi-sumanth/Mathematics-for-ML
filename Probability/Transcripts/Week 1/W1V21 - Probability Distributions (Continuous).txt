So now that you know about
discrete distributions, let me tell you about continuous ones. And there's a difference between the 2. In the discrete distributions,
your events always form a list. For example, if I toss a coin 3 times, I could get had 0 times,
1 time, 2 times or 3 times. I could also think of the number of
people in a town, it can be 0,1,2,3, a million, etc, but
I can always make a list of it. What is something that cannot be listed? An interval, for example, if my random
variable is the amount of time that I wait on the phone, or the amount of time I
wait for the bus, that cannot be listed. Because I could wait 1 minute, but
I could also wait 1.01 minute, or 1.2237 or pi minutes,
all these numbers cannot be listed. So, when your events are a list,
you have a discrete distribution. And when your events are an interval,
you have a continuous distribution. Let me elaborate more on that. So imagine you're a call
with tech support and you're trying to find the probability
that you will not wait too long. Let's say the call can take 1 minute,
2 minutes or 3 minutes, for example. And we can try to plot the probabilities,
say like this, where the heights of the bars are the probabilities that
the call takes 1, 2 or 3 minutes. But they can also take something like
1.01 minutes to respond, right, or 2.43. And you can quickly see that there's
infinitely many values the call could take. And these values are everywhere
between the ones you already have and also to the left and to the right. And if you remember from the last video, the sums of heights of all of
them have to be equal to 1. But you can quickly see that by adding
more and more and more of them, they have to get smaller and
smaller and eventually become 0. So what did we do wrong here? Well, we did nothing wrong. The answer is that this distribution
is fundamentally different, as it's not discrete,
but it is continuous. So this approach will not really work. To try to understand this, think of how
you would answer the following question, what is the probability that a call would
take exactly one minute to the dot? And I encourage you to think about this. The answer is zero, because there
are simply too many values for the amount of time a call can take. There's actually uncountably many of them,
it's a whole interval. And we're forced to say that
the probability that the call takes exactly 1 minute forever is 0. So we need to describe this problem
in a slightly different way. So instead of asking what is
the probability of the call taking a fixed amount of time,
let's think of it in terms of windows. So we're thinking of what's the
probability that the call lasts some time between a certain window,
say between 0 and 1. And for that we can have a probability and we can put it as the height
of this blue bar over here. Then we can think of as a probability that
the call lasts between 1 and 2 minutes. And that's this other height, or
between 2 and 3 minutes, or 3 and 4 minutes, and 4 and 5 minutes. And let's assume that the call
never takes more than 5 minutes. And now we have a discrete
probability distribution, where the blue area, so the sum of
the heights of these bars add to 1. And notice that the majority of the calls
take between 1 and 2 minutes, or between 2 and 3 minutes, not a lot of
them go all the way to 5 minutes and that's what this probability
distribution is telling us. Now imagine that we want to little more
information, so we want to make these intervals a little more granular,
so we make them 30 seconds instead. And now we have this distribution over
here, where we now know the probability that the call is between 0 and
half a minute, between half a minute and 1 minute, all the way to between 4
minutes and a half and 5 minutes. And if we want to make
them still more granular, we can make them of a quarter of a minute,
15 seconds, basically. And now we have all this
information between 0 and a quarter of a minute,
between a quarter and a half minute, all the way to between 4.75 minutes and
5 minutes. And we can continue splitting
these intervals and getting discrete distributions. And if we were to do this infinitely
many times, then what we get is this. This is how a continuous
distribution looks like. Imagine just a bunch of very,
very skinny bars, infinitely many of them,
that become just a curve. Now, in the discrete distribution, we had that the sum of heights
have to be equal to 1. The sum of heights was the same
as saying the blue area. So in the continuous distribution,
we have the same condition, the area under the curve is equal to 1. And that is a continuous
probability distribution.

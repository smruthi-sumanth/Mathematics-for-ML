In this video, you're
going to learn about the sum of probabilities,
which is quite simple. Consider the roll of a die. If you know the
probability of getting a two and the probability
of getting a three, and you want to know the
probability of getting a two or a three, then all you do is you
add these probabilities. However, there's a caveat. This doesn't work all the time. We need to know if the
events are disjoint. Let me explain. Let's go back to the school but now
we have more information. We have a school where kids
can only play one sport. This is going to be
important. The sport can be soccer or basketball. The probability that a
kid play soccer is 0.3. The probability that a
kid played basketball is 0.4. Here's a question. What do you think is
the probability that a kid play soccer or basketball? Remember at this school kids
can only play one sport, not two or more. If you want a hint,
imagine that there's only 10 kids in the school and do the calculations
like that. Let's remember that the kids
can only play one sports. Let's say there's 10 kids. If there's 10 kids then 30% play soccer,
that's three of them, and 40% played basketball, that's four of them, and that makes 70% of the kids. The probability that a kid
plays soccer or basketball is the number of kids who
play soccer or basketball, divided by the total
number of kids. That is 3+4 /10 or 0.7. Notice that we added
the probabilities. The probability of
soccer was 0.3, the probability of
basketball is 0.4, and the probability of
soccer or basketball was 0.7, which is 0.3+0.4. Now this can be seen in the
Venn diagram as follows. We're going to use the
letter U for union, and if all the children are here and 30 of them play soccer, that's over here, and 40
of them play basketball, then the union is the ones that play soccer or basketball so
is the ones I play soccer, and the ones that
played basketball, so is written like this, AUB. The probability of
AUB is the sum of the probabilities P(A) and P(B). Now let's see how the concept
of sum of probabilities reflect in a die example, let's say that you roll a
fair six-sided dice once. What is the probability
of obtaining an even number or a five? There are two events here. Event A is rolling
an even number. That's three of them, and event B is rolling a five
so that's one of them here. Because the
probabilities get added, then we have 3/6+1/6 and so the probability
of even number or five is probability
of even number plus the probability of
five, 3/6 +1/6. That is 4/6, which in
lowest terms is 2/3. Now, here's another question. If I roll two dice, then what's the
probability of obtaining a sum of seven or a sum of 10? Well, let's consider two events. The event A is that you
get a sum of seven, and the event B is that
you get a sum of 10. Out of the 36 possibilities, how many have a sum of seven? Well, there's the six over here. Under the same 36 possibilities, how many have a sum of 10? There's this three over here, 6,4 5,5 and 4,6. When you look at the union, so a sum of seven
or a sum of 10, then we're looking at all these events that are
colored red or yellow. Sum of seven, that is 6/36, and the sum of 10 is 3/36. When we add them,
we obtain 9/36, which in lowest terms is 1/4. This one over here
is the probability that the sum is seven, this one over here is the
probability that the sum is 10 and we just added them. Now let's see yet
another example. What's the probability
of obtaining a difference of two or
a difference of one? Well again, we have
the two events. A is the event that
difference is two, and B is the event that
the difference is one. Which pairs have a
difference of two? These pairs over here. 1, 3, 2,4, 3, 5 4, 6, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3 and 6,4 because the difference
can be in any direction, can be the first
minus the second, or the second minus the first. Similarly, for the
difference of one, we have all these
pairs over here. Now when we look at the union, they are over here, it's this many so the probability of the
difference is two, or the difference is one is
equal to the sum of the two. This one over here plus
this one over here. The first one, there's
eight cases out of 36 so it's 8/36, the second one is 10 cases
out of 36, so it's 10/36. When you add them, we get 18/36. That first one is the probability that
the difference is two, the second one is that
the difference is one. As you can see, 18 or 36 in lowest terms is one-half
so it's actually 50%.

Let's go back to the
coin-flipping experiment. Remember that you used a variable x to denote the number of heads
and that's a random variable. When you flip a coin, you can obtain heads or tails. The number of heads can be one was a probability of 0.5 or zero with a
probability of 0.5, we're going to call
that an experiment where we get a success if it lands on heads and a
failure if it lands on tails. Now, we can make
different experiments and also have success
and failures. If we roll a dice and we consider success when
it falls on one and failure when it falls on
anything different that means our variable is
the number of ones, then the probability
of success is 1/6 and the probability
of failure is 5/6. We can also have
other experiments, for example, if a patient
is sick or healthy, we can say that if
x is the number of sick patients then a success
is when the patient is sick, which is slightly contradictory
but since we're counting the number of sick patients
than in this case, x=1 is a success and the
probability for a sick patient, let's say it's p and for
the healthy patient is 1-p. These are all examples of the
Bernoulli distribution are very important distribution in probability and statistics, which has one parameter
and the parameter is p, the probability of success.

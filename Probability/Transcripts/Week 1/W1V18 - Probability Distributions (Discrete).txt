In lesson one, you learn how to
calculate individual probabilities and how to do math with them. But imagine that you have all
the possible scenarios that can happen. Put them on this horizontal axis and
for each one of them, look at the probability that they happen. This forms a probability distribution and
that's the topic for this lesson. So imagine now that you're
tossing three coins and you're interested in the number of heads. This will be your random variable. How does each outcome of the experiment
affect the random variable? Well, the first possibility
is that you get no heads. The second one is that you
get one out of three heads. But here you can see that you actually
have three options to obtain one heads, either on the first,
the second or the third coin. The same is true if you get
two heads out of three or you can get tails either on the first,
second or the third coin. And again, there's only one
option to obtain all three heads. Now, let's reorder this a bit. You can see that you just have one
way of getting three tails and one way of getting three heads. However, there are three ways in which you
can obtain one heads and two tails, or two heads and one tails. Now you can divide this number by
the total number of possible outcomes, which is 8. And what we get are probabilities for
each of the outcomes. And from this image you can clearly see
why it is much more likely to obtain 1 or 2 heads than 0 or 3. And it is because of how many different
outcomes contribute to each of these options. And now we can look at this
as just a normal histogram. Now let's look at another, slightly more
complex example where you flip four coins. Your new variable is the number
of heads in four coin tosses. And you can see that something
similar has happened. There's only one option when you
have all heads or all tails. However, there are four ways in which
you can obtain one heads or one tails. And finally,
this one's a bit more complex, but you have six possibilities where
you see two heads and two tails. This gives you a total of 16 possible
outcomes for how your coins can land. So you assign 1-16th to 1 and
4 heads, 4 over 16 to 1 and 3 heads. And finally, 6 over 16 to seeing 2 heads. And those are your probabilities. And this is the histogram we obtain for
4 coin tosses. Now let's look another variable,
the number of heads in 5 coin tosses. And again, with all heads or tails,
there's one option out of 32 total. With one header, one tail,
there's actually 5 options out of 32. With 2 or 3 heads,
there's actually 10 options. Now, it's easy to figure out that for
all heads there's only 1 possibility, or for only 1 head there's as
many possibilities as flips, because the head can
be any of the 5 flips. But how would you calculate that
there are 10 options for 2 heads? Luckily, there is some method for that. Stay with me in the next video
to find out how it works. Each bar represents the probability
that the variable x three takes each of the possible values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Now, for each x from 0 to 5,
you have the probability that X3 is X. This is called the probability
mass function of X3, and we use a lowercase p to represent it. All discrete random variables can be
modeled by their probability mass function, also abbreviated as PMF. Since it contains all the necessary
information to understand how the probability distributes among
all the possible values of the variable. Now, what are the requirements for
the PMF? First of all, since it's defined as
the probability that the random variable takes at a particular value,
then it always has to be positive. Now note that when you sum the PMF over
all possible values, they all sum to 1. This makes sense, since you're considering
the probability of all possible outcomes of the experiment. The second condition for the PMF is that
the sum of all its values must be 1. By the way, X1, X2, and
X3 are very similar. They're all counting the number of
heads in a fixed number of coin tosses. It was 3 for X1, 4 for X2, and 5 for X3. Also, the way the probability distribute
over all possible values follows a similar pattern. Could there be a single model to
represent all these random variables? It turns out there is, and
it's called the binomial distribution. You'll learn about that in the next video.

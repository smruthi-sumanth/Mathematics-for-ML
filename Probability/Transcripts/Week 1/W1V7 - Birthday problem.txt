Great work so far.
In this lesson, we're going to talk about one of the most fascinating problems in probability, the
birthday problem. Let's say you are with
three random people and you're wondering
what's the probability that two of you have
the same birthday? It's probably very low. Now, what if you were
with 200 random people? You would say it's
very likely that some two of them have
the same birthday. What about 30 people? What
about 50 people? 100 people? Well, let me show you what happens and the results
may surprise you. Here's the problem. You
have 30 friends at a party. Excluding yourself,
among those 30 friends, what do you think is more likely that there exists
two people who have the same birthday or that no two of them have the same birthday? Let's assume that this
year only has 365 days, so there's not going to be
any February 29 birthdays just for the sake
of this problem. The answer believe it or not, is that it's more
likely that two people have the same
birthday and in fact the probability of
no two people having the same birthday
is only around 0.3. Let me show you the math. That's non-intuitive because
if you think of 30 people, it doesn't look that likely that two of them have
the same birthday, but there's a 70
percent probability that two of them have
the same birthday. Let's see why. Here
is the entire year. Let's imagine that
there's 365 boxes here, even though there's less
but let's pretend there are and let's look
at the first friend. We're going to keep track of the probability that among the group that we're looking at, everybody has a
different birthday. If it's one person, obviously, they will not have the same
birthday as anyone else because the group only
has one person so the probability is
365/365, that's a one. Let me repeat that
last thing I said. The probability is
365/365, which is one. In other words, this
person can have a birthday any day of the year and it's not going to overlap
with anyone else. Now let's add a second person. What is the probability
that the two of them have a
different birthday? What's the probability
that among these two there's no
repeated birthdays? Well, the other one has to have pretty much a
birthday on any day that's not the same
day of the first one, so we multiply by 364/365. It's still pretty
high because it's unlikely that if you
take two people, they will have the
same birthday. Now let's add one more person. We want that person not
to have a birthday at the same time as any
of the other two so they can have a
birthday in any of the remaining 363
days out of 365. The probability that these three have all
different birthdays, now it's
365*364*363/365^3 because every time we have
a new event then we multiply it by
this probability. If we add a fourth person, well, now they can have a birthday
in any of the days that are not taking that's 362/365, and if we add a new person, they again can have
a birthday in any of the days that are not taken, so we multiply by 361/365 and if they add one more person, then we multiply by 360/365, and one more we'll
multiply by 359, and so on and so forth. If we have this group
of nine people, then what is the
probability that they all have birthdays
on different days? It's the product of
all these numbers, and that's actually 0.905. In other words, if I have
a group of nine people, the probability that there's no overlapping birthdays
is roughly 90%. It's very high because
among nine people most likely there are
not repeated birthdays. But now let's actually do the plot for this probability
with more people. As we saw, among a
group of one person, that probability there's no
repeated birthdays is one. For two people, remember that it was 364/365, that's 0.997, and we kept multiplying this by other factors like 363/365, etc., so when we keep
track of this product, then as you can seem the
number starts decreasing. For 20 people, it's
already 0.589. For 23 people, it's 0.493. For 23 people, it's
already more likely to have a birthday in common
than no birthdays in common. For 30 people, it's your 0.294. For 50 people,
it's already 0.03. Among 50 people, it's very, very likely to have them have
the same birthday. For 100 people, it's already very, very small, and for 366 people already it's zero because by then you
have to have one repetition. The plot is on the right, where in the horizontal axis we have the number of people, and in the vertical
axis the probability. Notice how quickly it drops. It stopped being bigger
than 0.5 around here, which is exactly at 23 people. If you are ever in a
party with 23 people, you can bet that there's
a repeated birthday, and you would win more
than half of the time. As you see, this was
quite non-intuitive. However, we calculate the probabilities and
that's what we got.

So let's apply this rule. In a school with 100 kids, again,
let's say 50 of them play soccer, and the other 50 don't play soccer. Now we're going to split them
into two rooms of size 50, and now they can go to any room they want but,
here is more information. The first room has a TV that
is showing the World Cup. And the second room has a TV that is
showing a movie that is completely unrelated to soccer. And each room fits 50 kids. Now, out of your intuition, how many kids
in room one do you expect to like soccer? And I'll remind you, the first room
has a TV playing the World Cup and the second one doesn't. So how many kids in room one do
you expect will like soccer? Well, all things being fair,
we can imagine that all the kids who like soccer went to the room with the TV
that's playing the World Cup. As illustrated, maybe this didn't happen,
but we can assume that that happened. So these two events, soccer and
room one are dependent, before they were independent,
but now they are dependent. In the example that we did previously,
the kids were split randomly. That made the events independent but
here, this is not the case. They're dependent so
the probabilities change. Now let's do a slightly different problem. Let's say we have a school of 100 kids,
40 of them play soccer and the rest don't. And among the kids that play soccer,
we've noticed that on any given day, 80% of them like to wear running shoes. So now help me estimate how many kids
play soccer and wear running shoes. So 40 kids are shown here and let's say that 80% of them
are wearing running shoes. So, let's split them into
groups of 20% each and four of these sections
are wearing running shoes. So that's 32, because 80% of 40 is 32. And 32 is our estimate for how many kids
like soccer and are wearing running shoes. So let's look at the same
problem from a different lens. The probability that a kid
plays soccer is 40%. That means if we have 100 kids,
40 of them play soccer, and that's P of soccer equals 0.4. Now, the probability of
not soccer is 0.6 or 60%. That means that among these 100 kids,
60 of them don't like soccer. Now among the kids that play soccer,
80% of them are wearing running shoes. Therefore, the probability of
running shoes given soccer is 0.8. Now we want the probability of soccer and
running shoes. Well, for that,
we need the probability of soccer. So that's this 40 over here
times the probability of running shoes given soccer,
which is this 80% over here. So 80% of 40 or 0.4 times 0.8, that's probability of soccer times
probability of running shoes given soccer. And we get 0.4 times 0.8 and that's 0.32. That is the 32% that we expect that
will play soccer and wear running shoes. So we say that the probability
of S intersection R is 0.32. Now let's look at something else. Let's say that somebody tells
me the following information. The probability that a kid wears running
shoes when they don't like soccer is 50%. That means that among the kids
that are not playing soccer, half of them wear running shoes. So what's the probability of
not soccer and running shoes? Well, P of not soccer
intersection running shoes, that means the kids who don't play
soccer and are wearing running shoes is equal to P of not soccer,
which is this 60% over here times P of running shoes given not soccer,
which is this 50% over here. And so that's 0.6, 60% times 0.5, it's 50% of 60%, and that's 0.3. And that is the probability that
a kid does not like soccer and is wearing running shoes. Another way to see things is
with a tree of probability. So two things can happen, the kid can play
soccer or not play soccer, play soccer with a probability of 40%, and doesn't
play soccer with a probability of 60%. Now, among the ones that play soccer, wears running shoes with probability
of 80%, that's P of error given S, and doesn't wear running shoes or
probability of 20%. And among the ones that don't play soccer,
wear running shoes or probability of 50% and doesn't wear
running shoes or probability of 50%. So there's four scenarios when they
play soccer and wear running shoes, play soccer and don't wear running shoes,
doesn't play soccer and wears running shoes, doesn't play
soccer and doesn't wear running shoes. And the probabilities
are S intersection R, 32%, which is 80% of 40%, or the product 8% for probability of S intersection R prime,
that's not R. That is the ones that play soccer and
don't wear running shoes, that's 20% of 40%, or
the product of 20% and 40%, which is 8%. For the ones that don't play soccer and
wear running shoes, that's 30% because it's 50% of 60% or
0.6 times 0.5. And the same thing for the ones that don't
play soccer and don't wear running shoes. So these are all the possibilities. So now let's recap the cases that we've
seen before since the very beginning. First, we split the kids
into two rooms randomly, and that created two independent events. Independent events can be seen
graphically when the two lines, the one that splits the kids
from the room one and room two, when the kids that play
soccer don't meet at a point. So these events are independent. Then we had the case when they were
running shoes or not wear running shoes. And those events were dependent, because
it's more likely that the kid wears running shoes if they are playing
soccer than if they're not. So those events are dependent. And another case was when we sent
them into two different rooms but one of them had a soccer game and
the other one didn't. Those cases were very dependent too,
because it's much more likely that the kid will go watch
the soccer game if they like soccer. Now, this may not be exactly
the same numbers we had before, but just to show you that this
case is also dependent. And so when the lines cross, the cases
are independent, like in the left, and when they don't cross,
they're dependent, like in the right.

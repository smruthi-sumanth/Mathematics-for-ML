Welcome back. In our
previous lessons, we talked about the sum of probabilities for
disjoint events. But what happens when the
events are not disjoint? Well, a problem may happen. Let me give you an example. Let's say that the probability
of rain is 80% and the probability of
being windy is 70%. What's the probability
of rain or wind? Well, if you add them,
you get 80% plus 70% and that's 150%. That is way too much, and it's completely wrong because the events
are not disjoint. You could have rain and
wind at the same time, and that's the key. In real-world situations,
events are not often disjoint and we need to account for this possibility of
overlapping outcomes. The sum rule for joint
events allows us to do this and to calculate the
probability of combined events. Get ready to dive deeper
into the world of probability and learn how to use the sum rule
for joint events. We're back to the school
from the previous example, except in this one, kids can play as many sports
as they want. They don't have that restriction that they can only
play one sport. The options are still soccer and basketball. Here's
a question for you. If the probability of a
kid playing soccer is 0.6 and the probability of a kid
playing basketball is 0.5, what's the probability
that a kid plays soccer or basketball? Again, if you need a hint, imagine that there's
only 10 kids in the school and do
the math like that. Let's see, this one's a
bit more complicated. Here are the 10 kids and
60% that play soccer are, for example, this six, and the 50% that
play basketball are, for example, this five. But this could change. There could be an overlap. When that happens, then we don't really know how many children
playing multiple sports. Let's look at it
in a Venn diagram. Here's 100% of the kids, and here's the 60%
that play soccer, and here is the 50%
that plays basketball. Originally we had this equation, P(S union B) is P(S) + P(B).
But that doesn't work. As a matter of fact, even
if you try to add them, you would get 110%, which is more than the number
of kids in the school, so there's something
we're over-counting. What we're over-counting
is this intersection here. That is this one kid
who plays both sports. That is P of S intersection B, the intersection of two events is when both of them
happen at the same time, so the kids who play
soccer and basketball. It could be one, but it could also be a
different number, could be three, for example. What we need is we need
the information of how many kids play both soccer and basketball in order to solve this problem. Here's the information. Same school and the kids can
play soccer or basketball. Now let's actually
do it with numbers. Six kids play soccer, five kids play basketball, and three kids play both sports. The question for you
is how many kids play soccer or basketball? It can be soccer or
basketball or both. Well, let's break
the problem down. Six of them play soccer, five of them played basketball, and that's all the
kids over here. Now we know that
three play both. That's eight because
there's two over here, don't play soccer or basketball. In the Venn diagram,
it's like this. Here's 100% of the kids. Here's the ones
that play soccer, here's the ones that
played basketball and the ones that play both are in this
extra section here. That's the ones that play
soccer and basketball. We have the following formula. The size of the
set S of kids that play soccer union
the set B of kids that play basketball
is the size of the set S. That is
the six over here, plus the size of the set B, which is this five over here. But we've over-counted. Notice that those
three kids that play both sports were counted twice, so we need to subtract them. We'd subtract these
three over here. Now we have a count of how many kids play soccer
or basketball as 6+5-3, and that's going to be eight. This is also known as the
inclusion-exclusion principle. Now we can represent
the same thing except with probabilities. Again, the same problem
with soccer and basketball. But now we're not
going to say that six kids play out of 10. We're going to say that the
probability of a kid playing soccer is 0.6 and the probability of a kid
playing basketball is 0.5, and the probability that
a kid plays both is 0.3. Given this information, what is the probability that a child
play soccer or basketball? Just like before, we
can do a Venn diagram. We can look at the
ones that play soccer and the ones
that play basketball, and the probabilities follow the same inclusion-exclusion
rule as before. We have P(S union
B) is P(S) + P(B). But we're over-counting
the intersections, over-counting P of
S intersection B. We have to subtract it because
we're counting it twice. That's 0.6 + 0.5 -0.3, which is 0.8. so let's turn into our
two examples visually, in the problem in the left, the kid can only play one sport, so the events are disjoint, is much easier to calculate
probabilities here because all we have
to do is add them. They don't overlap. In the case over
here, they overlap. In order to calculate
the probability of the union of the events, we need to take the
intersection into account. The case on the left is called disjoint events or
mutually exclusive, and for this case, the probability of the union is the sum of the probabilities. For the case in the right, this one is called joint and also called
non-mutually exclusive. For this, we have to follow
the formula P(S union B) is P(S) + P(B) - P
of S intersection B. Notice that the case in, the left follows from the
case in the right because S intersection B is
just the empty set, so the probability is zero. But to be more precise, we can look at both cases. Now let's see this
for a pair of dice. Question is what is the
probability of obtaining a sum of seven or a difference of one? Well, let's take a look. The sum of seven is all these cases over here,
as you've already seen, and the difference of one is
all these cases over here. Now before we used
to just add them, but this time is a
little more difficult. We're going to call
the one on the left A and one on the right B. We're going to say that A or
B is these ones over here, except that we have
double counted these two. The sum equals seven
and the difference is one are double counted. In order to not
double-count them, we have to subtract
that probability. The probability of sum equals
seven or difference is one is this 6/36 for the sum is 7
plus this 10/36, where the difference is one, minus what we're over-counting because for 4,3 and
3,4 are counted twice. We have to subtract 2/36. We get 6/36 + 10/36 -
2/36, and that's 14/36. That's P of sum equals seven
plus P of difference equals one minus P of sum equals
7 and difference equals 1, so 14/36, which in
lowest terms is 7/18

Welcome to lesson two. Now we get to one of the most
important concepts in probability, which is the concept of a random variable. And it's not something that new,
you've seen variables before. For example, in algebra you may have
learned the variable x equals 3, it always has the same value. Random variables are different,
they can take many values. For example, the temperature is a random
variable that can take many values. Another random variable is the number of
heads I obtain if I toss a coin 10 times. That is another random variable. So in this video I'm going to show
you all about random variables. So let's go back to the coin
flipping experiment. When you flip a coin,
let's say you can obtain heads or tails. And let's say that you can obtain them
both with a probability of one-half, like before. Now, let's change this
around a little bit. Let's take a variable X and
call it the number of heads. So what happens now when you flip a coin,
how many heads can we obtain? Well, if we obtain heads, then we
obtain 1 heads, and if we obtain tails, then we obtain 0 heads. If we look at X, then X can be
1 if we obtain heads once, and X can be 0 if we obtain heads 0 times. And the probability of X = 1 is the same
probability of obtaining heads, which is 0.5. And the probability of X = 0 is the same
probability of obtaining tails, which is 0.5. X is called a random variable and is one of the most important concepts
in probability and statistics. You can think of X as a variable
that not always has the same value. Half of the times it
takes a value of 1 and half of the time it takes
a value of 0 roughly. Now let's look at another random variable. Let's look at the number of heads
we obtain in 10 coin tosses. So let's say we flip it ten times and
all of them are heads, so X = 10. Or we flip them and one of them is tails,
so we obtain X = 9. And we can obtain X = 9
in many different ways. And let's say we stick to
probability of heads equals 0.5. So what are the probabilities
of these events? Well, since all of them are independent,
all of them have probability one-half, then this is one-half to the 10th. What about the second one? Well, it's also one-half to the 10th. But we can write it as one-half to the 9
for all the heads and one-half for the remaining tail, and
the same thing for the next one. However, a harder problem is to actually
ask what's the probability that we obtain 0 heads in total? P(X = 0) or P(X = 1) or
all the values until P(X = 10) because on the left we have a particular scenario,
a particular way to obtain the heads and tails, but
on the right we're grouping them all. As you can see, the first one is the same. P(X = 0) is the same as obtaining all
the heads, which is 0.5 to the 10. But the others are a little harder. So when I want to calculate things,
the first thing I do is run an experiment. So let's run an experiment. So let's say we run this experiment
many times and we obtain X = 5, X = 6, X = 5 again, and
we run it many, many times. And what are the possible outcomes? Well, the possible outcomes are 0 all the
way to 10, because you can obtain 0 heads, 1, heads all the way to 10. And if we stick to probability
of heads equals 0.5, and let's say we're going to repeat this
500 times and let's see what we obtain. The histogram we obtain
is this one over here. Notice this is just a histogram,
it's not the actual probabilities. But it gives us a good estimate of the
probabilities because we ran it a bunch of times. Notice that the probability of X = 0 or
X = 10 are the smallest ones, because it's not likely that we're
going to obtain 10 heads or 10 tails. The highest one is over here, P(X = 5),
because it's likely we're going to get roughly half-half, and
we can see all the other ones. For example, here's P(X = 8), that's
when you obtain 8 heads and 2 tails. So this is a random variable. Why do we care about random variables? Because they allow us to model
the entire experiment at once. And most problems in probability can
be expressed as random variables. So for example, if you flip
a bunch of coins, as we saw, and X is the number of heads,
that's a random variable. You can roll a bunch of dice and define
X as the number of times you obtain a 1. Or you can see a bunch of patients and
say that X is the number of sick patients. Or you can just define random variables. Let's say I define one that is 1 with
probability one-half, but it's also -7 with probability 0.2, and it's also
3.14159 with a probability of 0.3. I can come up with any random variable
I want that takes any values. As long as the probabilities add to 1,
I'm good. Now, here are other random variables. For example, if you are waiting for
the bus, the wait time until the next bus arrives is a random variable,
it could take many different numbers. The height of a gymnast's jump is also
a random variable that has some range of values. The number of defective products in
a shipment is also a random variable. And let's say the number of millimeters of rain in November is
also a random variable. You may be noticing that they
behave in different ways, and that's because there's two big
types of random variables. There's discrete and
continuous random variables. Discrete ones are the ones we've been
seeing so far, the number of 1s or 6s if I roll the dice, the number of heads
if I flip coins, the number of kids in a specific group with a particular
height or a particular age. And the continuous ones could be,
for example, the amount of time till the next bus
arrives, the height of a gymnast's jump, the number of millimeters of
rain in a particular month. Why are they different? I encourage you to take a look and
tell me why you think they are different. And one thing that happens is that the one
on the left can take a finite number of values. I can flip a coin ten times and
I could obtain 0 all the way to 10 heads. On the other hand, the ones on the right
can take an infinite number of values. Because the time can be 1 minute, but it can also be 1.01 minute or
1.001, 2, 3 minutes. There's an infinite number
of values they can take. But actually this is not true, the discrete ones can also take
an infinite number of values. I'll give you an example. If I start flipping a coin until I
obtain heads, I could do it one time, or two times, or three times, or four. I could do it 500 or a million and
perhaps not obtain heads. The probability is very small, but
I have an infinite range of values. So what really happens is that the
discrete ones can only take a countable number of values, whereas the continuous
ones take values on an entire interval. So the values that a discrete random
variable can take can be put in a list 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Whereas the values that a continuous
random variable take cannot be put in a list because it's an entire interval. Now you may be thinking, what's the
difference between these random variables and the ones that you see in algebra and
calculus? And the difference is that
the ones you see in algebra and calculus are deterministic and
the ones we see here are random. What is deterministic? For example, x = 2 or for example, the input of the function f(x) = x
squared, they always take the same value. Once it's defined, it's like that forever. However, the random
variable's not like that. It can take, for example, many values. They're associated with
an uncertain outcome. So deterministic variables
are associated with a fixed outcome and random variables with
an uncertain outcome. And that's the main difference.

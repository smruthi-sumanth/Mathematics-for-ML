Now let's reinforce a
constant probability, but this time around, we're going to use the
experiment of rolling a fair six-sided dice. Here's a question for you. What is the probability
that if you roll this dice you obtain a six? Well, given the fact that
six things can happen, and all of them are
equally likely, that's the sample space, and one of these
outcomes is favorable, so that's the event, then the probability P of six is one divided by six or one-sixth. Now, what if we roll two dice? What is the probability
of obtaining 6, 6? That's the next quiz for you. Well, let's look at the
entire sample space. For each roll of the first die, we can have six possibilities
for the second die, and we get 36 in total, 1,1, 1,2, 1,3, etc. all the way to 6,6. That's the sample
space of size 36. The event is just
this one over here, that's the only
favorable outcomes. The probability of 6,6 is 1/36. That's the answer.

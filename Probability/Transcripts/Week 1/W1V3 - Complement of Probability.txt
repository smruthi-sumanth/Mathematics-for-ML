So in the last video you
learned about how to calculate the probability of
the occurrence of an event. So in this video we're going to talk
about the complement of an event and its probability. So this is the probability
that the event does not occur. For example, if an event has
a probability of occurring of 75%, then the complement event or the probability that the event
does not occur is 25%. Let me elaborate. So let's go back to our school with ten
kids, where three of them play soccer and seven don't. Here's a question for you. What is the probability that a child does
not play soccer if they are picked at random? Well, to find the probability that
a child does not play soccer, that's denoted as P of not soccer,
then we do the same thing as before. We count the number of kids who don't play
soccer and divide it by the total number, and that's going to be seven divided
by ten, that is the answer 0.7. However, you may have noticed that that
is related to the probability that the kid plays soccer, because
the probability of not soccer is 0.7 and the probability of soccer was 0.3,
and they add to 1. Turns out this always happens. And we can rewrite this as 1- 0.3 this
is essentially the complement rule. The complements rule states that
the probability of an event A not occurring is equal to 1 minus
the probability of A occurring. So the probability of not soccer
is 1 minus the probability of soccer that's going to
be the complement rule. And we can formalize this rule as
follows P of A prime is 1- P of A, where A prime represents
the complement of the event A. That's when the event A does not happen. So, using this formula, we can calculate
the probability of an event not happening in a more
straightforward manner. Now, as a Venn diagram, you can see
this in a similar way as before. Here you have the sample space. Here you have the event of
playing soccer inside the circle. And the event of not playing soccer
is everywhere outside that circle, which is 70% if the circle is 30. Now, using the experiment of flipping
three coins, here's a question for you. What's the probability of
not obtaining three heads? Well, by the complement rule, the
probability that none of the coins land in heads that's P of not three heads is equal
to 1 minus the probability of three heads. And as you saw in a previous video,
this probability is 1/8. So we have 1 minus1/8,
and that is simply 7/8. You can also see it as the 7 good cases,
which are all minus the 3 heads divided by the 8,
which is the total number of cases. Now let's apply the complement
rule to the dice experiment. If you throw one die, what is the probability of obtaining
anything different than 6? Well, we know there are 6 outcomes, and
the probability of not 6 is equal to 1, this 1 is 6 over 6, minus 1 over 6,
the probability of landing in a 6. So, The 6 is over here, here we remove
one of them, which is landing in a 6. And the answer is 5 over 6.

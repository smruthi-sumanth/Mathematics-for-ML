Now you're ready to learn the simplest continuous
distribution of all, which is the uniform
distribution. I like to imagine it
as a bus, for example, let's say that a bus passes every 10 minutes, but I
don't know the schedule. So I just walk outside
and wait for the bus. What do you think happens with all the values of the
times I wait for the bus. Sometimes I take one minute, sometimes 5, 9, 7, 4.5, 3.52, etc. When you look at
all these numbers, they're pretty homogeneous in the interval from 0-10 minutes. That's how a uniform
distribution looks like. Let me elaborate. Imagine again at the example
of a support call center. Previously, we've looked at
some different histograms of probability of their
answer at different times. Now let's name some
of these examples and start with a
uniform distribution. Imagine that the call center
can answer in anytime from 0-15 minutes with
equal probability. If they don't answer
within 15 minutes, the call is disconnected. The last 200 times
you call them, you made a note of how
much time you had to wait. Notice that the points
seem to be more or less equally distributed
over the y-axis. That means that there is no particular wait
time or window or wait times that seems to appear
more times than the rest. In fact, this is what the
histogram looks like. Well, it seems that
one of the bars is slightly taller
than the rest. Let's not forget that
this is based on measurements so some
deviation is expected. Call T, the time in
minutes that you have to wait and
any value between 0 and 15 should have roughly the same
frequency of occurrence. Which means that the PDF must be constant on the
interval 0-15, so no value is favored
over the others. The question is, which
is the constant? Well, remember that
the area under the curve of the
density must be 1, so that times 15, which is the length of
the interval, must be 1. Therefore, the height
is 1/15 or 0.06. We can draw it over here. In general, a continuous
variable is set to follow a continuous distribution if all possible values have the same frequency
of occurrence, it has two parameters
which are associated to the interval where the
variable can take values. A is the beginning
of the interval and b will be the end of it. The probability density
function will be then 1/b-a, which is 1 over the
length of the interval, since the interval has length b-a as it goes from a to b, and it's 0 otherwise. It is that orange line
that is always 0, except it's 1/b-a at the
points between a and b. This animation shows what happens when we change
the parameters, more specifically the
starting and ending point. You can see that
when the interval a, b is bigger than
the PDF is smaller, the height of the
PDF is smaller, and it quickly increases as
the interval gets short. Now let's see what
the CDF looks like. Let's take a simple example, the uniform distribution
between 0 and 1. But you can see
that this applies to the uniform distribution between a and b just by changing the parameters
a little bit. First let's start by
considering some x less than 0. In this case, the area
under the PDF until that point from the left
until that point x is 0. Therefore, for any value
that is less than zero, the CDF is 0. Now, take any x between 0 and 1. The probability of the
variable being smaller than a particular x is this area over here.
This is a rectangle. You need to multiply
the length of the base, which is x, by the
height, which is 1. At that point, the CDF is x/1, which is the same as x. The same is valid for
any x between 0 and 1. The CDF is this line
here with slope 1. Finally, if you take
any x bigger than 1, you've already gathered all
the area under the PDF, so the probability stays as 1. This is how the CDF looks. Straight line, followed by a diagonal and then followed
by a straight line. The one on the left is 0 and
the one on the right is 1. For the general uniform
distribution between a and b, you can see that the CDF is the ratio between
the length of the segment ax and the length between the extreme
values a and b. For values of x between a and b, for x less than a, you have 0 cumulative
probability. Again, for x bigger than b, you've already gathered
all the probability, so therefore, the CDF
is 1 after that point

Now this is something
I mentioned before, but let me formalize it. We have something
called the prior, that is the original probability
that you can calculate, not knowing anything else. Then something happens,
and that's the event. The event gives you information
about the probability. With that information,
you can calculate something called the posterior. We had that the prior was P (A). An event can be called E, and the posterior is P(A/E). Now let me give
you some examples. In the spam email, the prior was 20 percent. The prior was the number of spam emails divided by the
total number of emails. The only thing I
know about an email, if I know nothing else, is that it has a 20 percent
probability of being spam because I know how many
emails are spam in total. That is a very basic unit of information and I need
to know a little more. We come up with a
condition, an event. It says that the email
contains the word lottery. Now the posterior changes. Now the probability
that the email is spam, given that it contains
the word lottery, is no longer the number of spam emails divided by the
total number of emails, but it's now the number
of spam emails with the word lottery divided by the total number of emails
with the word lottery. That's a much
better probability, that's a much more
accurate probability. The posterior is always
a better estimation than the prior because we have that event that gave
us information. In the medical example, there was also a prior, an event and a posterior. The prior was the original
probability of being sick. The event is the fact that
it diagnosed positive. The posterior was
the probability that you were sick given
that you diagnose positive. Now let's look at
another example. Let's say you're rolling two
dice and you want to find the probability that the
sum of the values is 10. We know that that's
three divided by 36. Now, if the events says that
the first dice is a six, then all of a sudden
your posterior changes. Now it's one-sixth because you
live in a different space. That is the posterior. In another example,
the coin example, if you want to find the
probability that both coins land in heads, then
that's one-quarter. But the event says that the
first coin lands in heads. Therefore in the posterior, you no longer have
the second row and the new probability
is one-half

In this video, we're going to look
at the concept of independence. Independence happens when the occurrence
of one event does not affect the probability of
the occurrence of another event. For example, if I toss a coin twice, whatever happened on the first throw does
not affect the outcome of the second one. On the other hand, if I'm playing chess, whatever happened on the 10th move
affects what happens on the 11th move. So these are not independent, but
the coin throws are independent. Understanding independent is very
important in probability and in machine learning, because assuming that
things are independent actually helps us simplify calculations and
make predictions. So let's calculate one more probability. In a school, there are 100 kids, half of
them so 50 of them like playing soccer, and the other half do
not like playing soccer. The kids are randomly split
into two equal rooms, each one of them of size 50. That's room 1 and room 2. So for this question, you're not
required to make any calculations. The question is, based on your knowledge,
what is your best estimate about the number of kids
in room 1 who would like soccer? And remember, the kids were randomly
split into two equally sized rooms. So the split will most
likely look as follows. Roughly 25 kids in the first
room will like soccer, and roughly 25 in the second room. Because they were randomly split,
there was no reason to go to room 1 versus room 2,
and so that is 25 each. Obviously, something different would have
happened, but our best estimate is 25. Because if roughly half of the kids play
soccer and they're split into two rooms half half, then roughly half of the kids
in each one of the rooms play soccer. Now, imagine another school with 100 kids,
but in this school only 40 of them like playing soccer, which means 60 of
them don't like playing soccer. The kids are randomly split into two size,
this time of different size, room 1 can fit 30 kids and
room 2, 70 kids. So, same question as before. Based on your knowledge, what is your best estimate about how
many kids in room 1, the smaller room, like to play soccer, or at least what
would you expect this number to be? Well, since the split is 40-60 for
soccer and not soccer, we expect that since we separated the kids
randomly, then in each of the rooms, the split is going to be 40-60 again. So we expect 40% of the kids
in room one two like soccer, and that's exactly 12 kids,
because 40% of 30 is 12. More clearly, we have 40% of 100 kids
playing soccer, that is 40 kids. And the probability of a kid
playing soccer is 0.4. And then there's 60 kids
who don't play soccer, so the probability of a kid not
playing soccer is 60% or 0.6. Now, we can split them into two rooms. There's 30% of the kids in room 1. So the probability of room 1 is 0.3. And the question is what is
the probability that a kid plays soccer and is in room 1? So we have P of soccer, which is 0.4, and P of R1, room 1, which is 0.3. And we're looking for
this probability over here. So probability of soccer,
intersection room 1. And as you can see, that the probability
of soccer times the probability of room 1 which is over here,
that's 0.4 x 0.3. In other words,
remember that we took 40% off 30%. That means we're multiplying them and
we get 12% or 0.12. What we're talking here is
the intersection of two events. When you see the word and
that's intersection. So the probability that a kids play
soccer and is in room 1 is because those events are not related,
are independent of each other, then it's the product of the two
probabilities P(S) and P(R1). So we get to the product rule. The product rule simply says probability
of a intersection B is probability of A times the probability of B. This is going to be very useful,
but remember, the events have to be independent and we're going to
see more details about this later. To continue illustrating the intersection
of independent events and the probability of that, we're going
to look at a coin example again. So let's consider tossing
a fair coin five times. Here's a question for you. What is the probability that the coin
lands in heads all five times? Well, note that each event is independent
from all the other ones because one coin landing in heads does not
affect any of the other ones. Therefore, the probability is
the probability of the first one lands in heads, which we know it's one half times
the same thing for all the other ones. So it's one half times one half times
one half times one half times one half. And that is going to be 1/32 because it's 1/2 to the five and that is 1/32. So this product rule can be extended,
it's not just two events. But if you have many independent events
all independent from each other, then the probability that they all
happen is the probability of all of them happening separately. So now let's look at some dice. Recall that when a dice is rolled,
a probability of obtaining a six is 1/6. So now when two dice are rolled,
what's the probability of obtaining 6,6? Well, we've calculated this before, but we
can actually do it with the product rule. This was 1/36 because we have 1 here and
36 cases. However, if we look at both
events separately, they're independent events because one rolling of
the dice does not affect the other one. And what's the probability that
the first one lands in six? Well, it's one sixth. And for
the second one it's again one sixth. So we multiply them and we get one sixth squared, which is 1/36. Now, what is the probability that
if I roll ten different dice, all of them fare, I get 10 sixes? Well, as you can imagine, the probability
is the probability of getting one sixth to the power of 10,
because all these roles are independent, that's one sixth to 10, which is a very,
very, very small number. So as you've learned in this video, the probability rule says that
if you have independent events, the calculation of the probability of all
of them happen at the same time is easy. It's just a product of all of them.

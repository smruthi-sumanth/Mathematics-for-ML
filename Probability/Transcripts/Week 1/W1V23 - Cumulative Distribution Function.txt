Now that you've learned the
probability mass function for discrete distributions and the probability density function for continuous distributions. Let me show you what the cumulative
distribution function is. Let's look at the example
of the phone call. In this example,
you actually have to calculate areas underneath a curve in order to find the probability that
a call is between, let's say, two and
three minutes. This is not convenient. We don't want to be
always calculating areas. The cumulative distribution
function is one that shows the actual probability
that the call is between zero and a
certain number of minutes, so it's much more
convenient to calculate. There's also a cumulative
distribution function for discrete distributions. Let me show you more about
it. Let's have a look at another concept that is the
cumulative probability. Cumulative probability
tells you what is the probability that an event happened before some
reference point. For example, let's return to the call center and let's start thinking about the discrete simplification of the problem. The one where we looked at the probabilities being
between zero and one minute, one and two, all the way to between four and five minutes. Then as usual, we'll slowly
move to the continuous one. But for now, let's
look at this one. Now, let's take a look on the right at what's called
the cumulative probability. The probability that the call is between zero and one minute, and that's exactly the same as the one in the left because
that first little rectangle is the probability that the call is between
zero and one minute. Now, let's look at
the probability that the call is between
zero and two minutes. What do you think that is? Well, on the left,
it's going to be the sum of these two areas. The reason is because
being between zero and one minute
is the same as being between zero and
one or one and two. We're adding those two areas. On the right, we're
going to get this. Remember, on the right, we're looking at the probability being between zero and one, then between zero and two. The next one is between
zero and three. So between zero and three is the sum of these three areas. We plot them here. Then
between zero and four, the sum of these areas. And then finally
between zero and five, which is all the
areas, and obviously, we know that this is one
because the probability that the call between zero
and five minutes is one. Now we can draw the
cumulative probability for this discrete
distribution to the left, and it's this red curve over
here. Notice two things. It always starts at zero. For example, it is clear
where zero should be. There are no calls that
take negative time. In general, the cumulative
distribution is zero up to the point where we
expect no outcomes at all. Secondly, the value at
the very right is one, because we know that all the calls will be
five minutes or less. So the probability
that the calls between zero and five minutes is one. These cumulative
distribution function always starts at zero
and ends at one. For continuous distributions, we have something very similar. You go over the PDF from
the beginning until the end and you simply add up the
pieces to create the CDF curve. Except in the continuous case, you're not adding together
the heights of the bars, but you're plotting the sum
of the area under the curve. It's the same as
[inaudible] case. The point at the very left is zero because you
haven't added any area. The point of the very right is one because that's where
you've added all the area. Now this is a particular
case where the curve starts and ends
at finite points. But the blue curve in the left, the density function
could go infinitely to the left or infinitely to
the right, in which case, so does the other curve, and that means that it
has a limit of zero to the left and a limit
of one to the right. Finally, at some
point x, this area, this black area over here, it's going to be this
height over here. For example, the
probability of the call is less than or equal
to two minutes. Let's say it's one-half. Then on the right, we have that the height of the
point x or the 0.2 is one-half because
as the probability of the call is less than or
equal to two minutes. In other words, these
two curves give us the same information
except written different. On the left, we
have to calculate areas to find probabilities, and on the right, we simply
have to look at heights. So far I've got a
pretty good intuition about the cumulative
distribution function. Let's look at some notation
and some formalism. The CDF is a function that
tells you how much probability a random variable accumulates
up to a certain value. The CDF is actually
the probability that your random variable x is smaller than or equal
to some value x. This is defined for
each and every value on the real line from minus
infinity to plus infinity. This function is
normally denoted with a capital F. Please
be mindful not to use lowercase f because
that's the one we served for the probability
density functions of continuous distributions. Exactly as with PDFs. We add a subscript with the random variable
for extra clarity. In this case, it's capital X. If your variable was called
capital Y, for example, then you would call the cumulative
distribution function F_Y. Notice that if your variable
is discrete like the one on the left and the
CDF will have jumps. Why does this happen?
Well, consider this point over here and the CDF where the
function blanks. This means that this
particular point is not a possible outcome of the variable you're modeling, so it doesn't accumulate
any probability. However, at the values
that are possible outcome, you see a jump into CDF. The height of that jump is
exactly the probability that the variable has taken on
that particular value. For continuous variable,
the CDF shape changes a lot and you get a continuous
function. Why is this? Because each point doesn't have probability
mass on its own, and once you don't
have points with mass, then you don't see any jumps. So the CDF curve is smooth. Now what properties of
the CDF need to satisfy? First is, by definition, it's a probability
all values have to be between zero and one. Also, the left point of
the CDF needs to be zero. In some cases, it's
a fixed number, in some cases, it's
n minus infinity. But nonetheless,
it has to be zero. The right endpoint where all the probability
has been accumulated, the CDF has to be one. Finally, the CDF can
never decrease since it's accumulating
probabilities and probabilities can
never be negative, then this is a must. To really summarize,
on the left, you have a PDF which is written as a function f(x), let's say. It's a function that's
always positive and has a total area of one
underneath the curve. The CDF has a left
endpoint of zero, our right endpoint of one, and it's always positive, and it's always increasing. Sometimes you're going
to be using the PDF, and some other times you're
going to be using the CDF depending on which one's more
convenient at the moment, but it's good to know
both really well.

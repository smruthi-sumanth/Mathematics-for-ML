Welcome to Week 1. This
week has two lessons. In the first lesson,
you will learn how to calculate probability
for different types of random events using rules of probability
and Bayes' theorem. In Lesson 2, I will introduce
you to the concept of a probability distribution and some examples of commonly used
probability distributions. But what exactly
is a probability? This is what we're going to
be looking at in this video. Simply put, probability is a measure of how likely
an event is to occur. For example, if I
throw a fair coin, the probability that it lands in heads is 50 percent or 1/2. If I throw a dice, the probability of it landing
in the number 4, is 1/6. Want to know more?
Let's get started. To get started, we're
going to explore an intriguing problem that will test your probability skills. Imagine you're in a
school with 10 kids and you want to randomly pick
a kid from the population. In this school, three kids
play soccer and seven don't. The question is, what is the
probability that the kid you picked at random
plays soccer? Are you ready to
find out the answer? Let's dive into the
world of probability and learn how to solve
this problem together. Recall that you want to find the probability
that a child picked at random plays soccer. In math, we have a way to
denote this statement. We will use P(soccer) to denote the probability
that the kid plays soccer. To find the probability
that a child plays soccer denoted by
P(soccer), first, we need to know the number
of kids who play soccer and the total number of
children in the school. We will express this in
the probability formula; number of kids who plays soccer divided by the total
number of kids. The probability of a
random kid playing soccer is 3/10 or 30 percent, can be also written as 0.3. The numerator is
represented by the event, the outcome's favorable
to the experiment, which in this case is the
kids who play soccer. The number of kids who
play soccer is three. That's the size of the event. The denominator corresponds
to the sample space, the total possible outcomes, and the number of those is 10. That's the size of the sample space, and
there you have it. We successfully
solved the problem using the basic principles
of probability. By understanding
this simple problem, you will be able to
apply these concepts in more complex
real-world situations in machine learning
and data science. Now, using the concept
of Venn diagrams, the total population, all the children are represented here by the green rectangle. This will be 100 percent
of the population. The green rectangle, including the kids who play
soccer and those who don't is the sample space, 30 percent of the kids who play soccer will be in this circle. This is the event, the group of items
you're interested in. The kids who do not play soccer would be outside the circle, but still in the green rectangle because they're still
part of the population. We can calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of
possible outcomes. In our next example, we're
going to be flipping a coin. When we do that, the coin can land
in heads or tails. Because this activity
of flipping a coin producing an outcome
that is uncertain, we're going to call
this the experiment. In probability, an experiment
is any process that produces an outcome
that is uncertain. Thus, in our content, throwing a coin
is an experiment. We'll determine the probability
of the coin landing in heads denoted by P(heads). We're going to be flipping
a fair coin meaning that each outcome heads or tails
is equally likely to occur. Both of them occur with
50 percent probability. P(heads) is equal
to the event of landing in heads divided by
the total number of outcomes, and that's 1/2 or 0.5. Now let's make the
problem a bit more complex and throw two coins. What will be the probability of both of them landing heads? To answer this question,
let's work through the experiment to determine
the total number of outcomes. The first coin can land
in heads or tails. Now for each outcome
of the first coin, the second one can land
in heads or tails. Our final outcomes
are, heads heads, heads tails, tails
heads, and tails tails. Those are four outcomes. Now, with these outcomes, what is the probability of
both coins landing in heads? That is the upcoming quiz. Out of these four
possible outcomes, we're interested
in the one where both coins land in heads. There's only one such outcome
which is heads heads. The probability of both
coins landing in heads, denoted as P(HH) is the
number of favorable outcomes, which is one, divided by the total number
of outcomes, which is four, so that's 1/4 or 0.25, also called 25 percent. That's the probability of
both coins landing in heads. Now, what if we
flipped three coins? Well, let's calculate
the probability of the three of them landing in heads when you
throw three coins. We can throw the
first coin and it can land in heads or tails. Now, the second coin
for each outcome of the first coin can land
in heads or tails. The third coin, for
each outcome of the first and second coins
can land in heads or tails. How many total outcomes we
have? We have eight of them. All heads, heads heads
tails, heads tails heads, heads tails tails,
tails heads heads, tails heads tails, tails tails heads, and tails tails tails. That is eight outcomes. Now the question for you is, what's the probability of
landing on heads three times? Well, out of these eight
possible outcomes, we're interested
in the one where the three of them land in heads. That is one divided by the total number of
outcomes, which is eight. Therefore the answer
is 1/8 or 0.125.

So imagine that you have a data set,
for example, heights of people, but you need it to be larger, but you can't go
and collect more data, it's too expensive. So what can you do? Well, you can create some synthetic data
that looks a lot like the original one. And a way to do this is to construct
a distribution out of this data, and then sample out of it. And by sampling I mean picking
points that have the probabilities given by the original distribution. So this is a very important concept in
probability and in machine learning, sampling probability distribution. Let me show you. Let's say you have a simple discrete
distribution of our colors, with three possible outcomes green,
blue and orange. And you get green with probability 0.3,
blue with probability 0.5, and orange with probability 0.2. And now you want to run an experiment
where you want to create a random sample of data that follows this distribution. So how do you sample data
from this distribution? Well, as you know, the probabilities
of the outcomes add to one, So you can stack them up together like this
to get a continuous strip between 0 and 1. Now, computers can choose a random
number from a given interval uniformly. So to simulate the distribution
you need to follow three steps. First, generate a random
number between 0 and 1. Second, find out which of the three
intervals the generated number belongs to. And then third, assign the correct
color based on the interval. That will help you pick a random
color between green, blue and orange, with the probabilities that
are given in this graph. Now, let's say that instead of green,
blue and orange, you assign these outcomes some numbers,
let's say 0, 1 and 2. The process will be exactly the same. So let's take a look at another
way to solve this problem. Let's create another plot here where
we simply rotate at the bars, and what we're going to do is we're
going to push them to the right and draw that red line, which is actually
the cumulative distribution function. And now all you have to do is you sample
uniformly from the vertical interval. So these four points are sampled
uniformly, and then you simply read out what the value is in the horizontal axis
of the cumulative distribution function. And then you are picking the numbers
according to the distribution on the left. We can also do this for a continuous one,
and it's actually very beautiful. Check it out. When you have, let's say,
the Gaussian distribution on the left, you want to pick randomly
from this distribution. It's not easy because
calculating areas is hard. But if you take a look at the CDF on
the right and then you pick uniformly from that gray interval,
the interval from 0 to 1, that's vertical. Let's say we pick some
numbers here uniformly. And now all we do is we take a look at
where this hits the distribution and where it hits the horizontal axis. So this points over here
are actually distributed based on the normal
distribution on the left. As you can see, this is the distribution
that these points are taken from, and when you look at them on the left, that's the exact distribution
that they're taken from. So the CDF, both for
the discrete and the continuous case, is a very useful method when you want to
sample from a particular distribution.

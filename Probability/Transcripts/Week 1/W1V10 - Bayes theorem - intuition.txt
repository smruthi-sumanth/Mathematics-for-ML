So imagine the following scenario. There's a rare disease going on and
you want to get tested for it. So you go to the doctor and the doctor
says, I have a very effective test, which is correct most of the time. You take the test and then go home. And then the doctor calls and
said you tested positive, so maybe it's time to panic. But before panicking,
I always do some math. So the idea is to calculate
the probability that you have the disease, given the fact that you tested positive. This is an example of Bayes theorem. Bayes theorem is one of the most
important theorems in probability and is used all over the place,
including in machine learning. It is used for spam recognition,
speech detection, and many other things. So let's take a look at Bayes theorem
in this example with some numbers. So let's put some numbers. Let's say there's a million
people in the population, and let's say that the illness only
affects one of every 10,000 people. Now, the test that the doctor
gives you is 99% effective. What does that mean? That means two things that
out of every 100 sick people, 99 get correctly diagnosed as sick, and
one gets incorrectly diagnosed as healthy. And among every 100 healthy people,
one gets misdiagnosed as sick and 99 get correctly diagnosed as healthy. Now, you went to the doctor and
you tested sick. So now the question is,
are you really sick or not? More specifically,
what is the probability that you're sick, given that you tested sick? Let's try to find this
probability before panicking. So here's a quiz to test your intuition. Where do you think that probability lies? So let's look at the million people
to find out the probability. Among the 1 million people,
only one out of every 10,000 is sick. So 999,900 are healthy and
only 100 are sick. Now let's test every single person. So here on the left, we're going to
have the ones that were diagnosed sick, and on the right,
the ones that were diagnosed healthy. Now, since the test is 99% effective,
then among them many, many healthy ones, it only made a mistake in 1% of them,
and that's this 9999 here. So those were healthy people
who were diagnosed as sick. This group over here was 99%
of the healthy people that were correctly diagnosed as healthy. This group over here on
the bottom now is the sick ones. And since the test again is 99% healthy,
that means the test correctly diagnosed these
99 out of 100 sequence, and it misdiagnosed this one person here
as healthy while the person is sick. Now let's look at the people
who are diagnosed sick. We have to figure out
the probability that you're sick, given that you were diagnosed sick. So we're only looking at
the left two rectangles. The probability that you're sick, given
that you diagnose sick means you only live here because these are the people
who were diagnosed sick. And what is the probability that
you're sick among this group? Well, in this group,
only 99 people are sick. And what's the total? 99+9999. So most of them are actually healthy. Can you see? Again, most of the people who were
diagnosed sick are actually healthy. There's 9999 of them, and
only 99 who were actually sick. So the probability that you're
sick when you belong to this group is simply
99 divided by 99+9999. That's 99 divided by 10,098, which is
0.0098, which is actually less than 1%. So isn't that astonishing? You were diagnosed sick, but the probability that you're
actually sick is less than 1%. The probability that you are sick and diagnosed sick is the number
of people who were sick and diagnosed sick divided by the total
number of people who were diagnosed sick. But a lot of people were diagnosed sick,
because that 1% of the healthy people who were diagnosed
sick is a lot bigger than the one out of every 10,000 who were
actually sick and diagnosed sick. And what you saw here was just
an example of Bayes theorem. We can look at it as a tree. Let's say here's, 1 million people. Here are the 100 sick ones. There's not too many. And the 999,900 healthy ones. Now, among the sick ones, some of them
are diagnosed sick, that is 99% of them. And some of them are diagnosed healthy,
which is 1% of them. Now, among the healthy ones,
1% are diagnosed sick. That's misdiagnosed, and
99% of them are diagnosed as healthy. So we have four groups the sick and
diagnosed sick, that's 99 people. The sick and misdiagnosed as healthy,
that's one person, the healthy and diagnosed sick,
which is a misdiagnosis. There's 9999 of them. And the healthy and diagnosed healthy,
which is the majority of the population. Now, since you went to the doctor and
got diagnosed sick, then you are in one of these two groups. These are the diagnosed sick. So those are the groups that matter. And if you're in these groups,
most of them are healthy and misdiagnosed. So the probability that
you are actually sick is 99 divided by 10,098,
which is less than 1%. So a little surprising, but
that's Bayes theorem in action.

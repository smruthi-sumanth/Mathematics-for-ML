So when you learn discrete distributions, you learned that each
event had a probability. For example, the probability that
I throw a coin ten times and three of them land in
heads is a certain number. When we talk about
continuous distributions, we cannot talk about those
probabilities in the same way. For example, if I make a phone call,
the probability that the phone call lasts exactly two minutes to
the dot at is zero. But I can still talk about intervals. I can talk about the probability that
a phone call lasts between two minutes and three minutes, or between two minutes and
two minutes to 30. These probabilities are encoded in
something called the probability density function. Let me show you how. So, before we return to the plot
from the previous video, let's take a look at another simple case. Let's say that the call
center answers with equal probability at any time window
between 0 and 5 minutes. So, as you can see here, if we divide
this area in five different parts, then the probability that the length
of the call lands in any of the five rectangles is exactly the same. So, given this information, what is the probability that the call
is between 2 and 3 minutes long? Well, if you said 0.2 or
20%, that is correct. It's also one fifth,
because there are five equal parts and this area adds to one because
it's a probability distribution. So the area of that little
rectangle is one fifth. And that's the probability that the phone
call lasts between 2 and 3 minutes. Now, let me ask you another question. We're going to split it now in ten
small intervals of 30 seconds. What is the probability that the call
lies between 2 and 2.5 minutes? Well, for the same reason it's 0.1,
because it's one tenth. This time the intervals are shorter, so the probability that it lies
between that interval is smaller. So what you can notice here is that the
height of towers doesn't change at all, but their width was halved, and therefore,
the probabilities have also been halved. This is because now we're not
looking just at heights, but at actual areas, and
the base is no longer one. So now we can't think of heights of towers
instead, we need to think about areas. Now, let's return to the previous
example of the call center, where the calls are not equally
likely to be of the same length. Now, the call is more likely between 1 and
2 minutes, or between 2 and 3, and not so likely to be between 4 and
5 minutes. So what's the probability that a call
lasts between 1 and 2 minutes? Well, it's this area over here,
and the probability that it lasts between 1 and
1 minute 30 is this area over here. Now, if I have the areas much,
much more granular like this, what's the probability that's
between 2 and 3 minutes? Well, it's going to be the sum of all
the shaded areas between 2 and 3 minutes. So we're getting to
the continuous distribution. What is the probability that the call
lasts between 1 and 2 minutes? Well, now it's going to
be this area over here. If we were interested in the probability
that the call is exactly 2 minutes, then we'll be talking about
the area of this segment over here, that is a line segment,
and it has no area. So, that's why we say that
that probability is 0. So now, we can only think of probabilities
between different windows of time, no longer one particular time. So to recap, as we divide the intervals
into smaller and smaller, also the areas get smaller and
smaller until they get to zero. So that's why we have to look into
intervals and not just heights. So as I told you before, this function is
called a probability density function, or PDF for short, and
it's usually denoted as a lowercase f. It is the equivalent of the lowercase
p in the discrete distribution. The equivalent of the mass function is now
it's called probability density function. And for added clarity you can
add a subscript of the variable, it's representing that's the capital x. PDFs are a function defined only for
continuous variables and it represents the rate at which you
accumulate probability around each point. You can use the PDF to
calculate probabilities. How do you do that? Simply by getting the area under
the PDF curve between points A and B. Now, what does a function need to
satisfy in order to be considered a PDF? Well, first it needs to be defined for
all the numbers in the real line. That means that it can actually
be zero for many values. For example, before zero or
after the cutoff at the right. But it doesn't need to, it could be
positive for all the numbers and the area still being 1 if it gets really,
really, really tiny at the tails. And it also needs to be positive or
0 for all values. This is reasonable because otherwise
it would get placed in negative probabilities. And you know that probabilities
cannot be negative. And finally,
the area under the curve has to be 1. Again, this restriction comes
from the probabilities. The area under the curve is simply the
probability of all possible outcomes of the variable, and
it always needs to add to 1. So here's a small summary. Let's take a look at discrete
random variables, and remember, that they can only take a finite or
at most accountable number of values. While continuous random variables are used
to model experiments where the outcome can take any value in an interval. Because of this difference between
discrete and continuous random variables, each kind will have their own way
of describing the behavior and computing probabilities. To measure the probability of events in
the case of a discrete random variable, you have a probability mass function, which is defined as the probability
that x takes on a particular value. For the continuous random variable,
you have the probability density function. And remember that for
this type of variable, the probability that the variable takes
on a particular value is always 0. So you need to look at areas on this side.

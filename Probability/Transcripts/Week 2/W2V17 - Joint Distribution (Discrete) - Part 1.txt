Previously you learned probability distributions
for one variable, for example, the height
of a population. But what if I want to
look at two variables? For example, the height of the population and the
age of the population, that's two distributions, and I may want to look at them together and see how these
two features combined. For that, we need a joint distribution and that's what you're going
to learn this video. Consider a simple dataset
of 10 children, age 7-10. Always count the
children for each age. There's three children of age 7, two of age 8, four of age 9, and one of each 10 for
a total of 10 children. Let's plot this
count data here on a graph and it gives
us this histogram over here where this is the number of
children of each age. Now if we divide by 10, we can turn these numbers
into probabilities. The probability, for example, that a child is age 9
in this dataset is 0.4. Now, for the same children who say we capture their
height data as follows. These are their heights in inches and we're
going to generate another table with the
number of children of each height rounded
to the nearest inch. We can put these in a
histogram as well. Notice that there's no
child of height 48, but to complete the axis, let's bring that value back. Again with a total
of 10 children. Now let's divide the counts by 10 to get the probabilities. For example, the
probability that a child is 47 inches is 0.2
in this dataset. We have the dataset ordered
by these two metrics, age, and height. Now, here's a question for you. What is the probability
that a child is nine years old and 49 inches
tall in this dataset Well, let's see from the probability
mass function for age, how many children
are nine years old? We have four of them. I'm looking at the
graph, the height, only three of these four
children are 49 inches tall so dividing this three
by the total of 10 kids, we get 3 out of 10 on
the probability is 3/10, and we're going to call age, h and height y. Those are two variables, and so the probability that
a child is nine years old, and 49 inches tall, which is 3/10 can
be written as p[x, y] 949 x, the age
has to be nine, and y the height has to be 49. More generally, the
joint probability of two discrete
variables is denoted by P(XY) the name of
the variables of x, y, which are the values that I
want these variables to take, the 9 and the 49, and that's the
probability that X, which is age is
equal to little x, 9 in this case and that's why the variable for height is equal to little
y, which is 49. But we can calculate
these probabilities easier if we organize
the data properly. Let's construct a joint
counts for two variables, and we're going to have
something like this. There's one child whose age is seven and height is
45, we put them here. Then there's two
children of age 7 and height 46, and they're here. Then we have zeros for
the rest of the row because there's no more
children to height 7, then some zeros here, and two children of
age 8 and height 47 and then no more
of age 8 and then there's three children of
age 9 and height 49 and one of H9 and height
50 and finally one of age 10 and height 50. This is the table of counts, which we can turn into a probability mass function when we divide everything by 10. Now we have the probabilities for each possible
combination of data. All possible
combinations of x and y are what's called a
joint distribution. In this case, it's a
discrete joint distribution because both ages and heights
are discrete variables. Now let's solve
some more questions with this joint distribution. For example, what is the
probability that a child is eight years old and
48 inches tall? Recall the formula for
probability descriptor variables, and this is going to
be 0 because there's zero children of age
8 and height 48. Let's do one more. What's
the probability that the age is seven and
the height is 46? That was over here,
which is 2/10. This is an example of a joint probability
distribution function

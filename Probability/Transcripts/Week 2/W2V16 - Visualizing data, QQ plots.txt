Now, checking for normality in data
is frequently done in data science. Many models, such as linear regression,
logistic regression, and Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, assume that the
variables follow a Gaussian distribution. Some other tests used in data
science also assume this hypothesis. But how can we tell if the data
follows a normal distribution or not? Well, sometimes a quick inspection of
something as simple as a histogram can let us know that data is in Gaussian. For example, the left one
doesn't look very Gaussian, and the right one looks a little gaussian. But how do we get a more exact
answer if the data is Gaussian or not when it looks bell shaped
like the one in the right? Well, for that we use quantile
quantile plots, or QQ plots. These are a great tool to visually
inspect if your data is Gaussian. This present a graphical comparison
between quantiles in your data and quantiles from a normal distribution. In the most classical form, your data is
first standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Then you compare the quantiles
of your data, and finally, it computes the same quantiles for
a standard normal distribution. And it creates a scattered plot where the
x value are the theoretical quantiles and the y value are the sample quantiles. Note that in each point, the scatter
plots correspond to one of the quantiles. If your data was actually
normally distributed, then the points should be
close to this orange line. This QQ plot corresponds to
the newspaper budget data, so it's suspected that the data
wasn't going to be Gaussian. This is especially obvious if you look at
the two marked areas where the scatter plot really splits from the orange line. Also, the fact that there's more
concentration of points on the area to the left than the one to the right
is a sign that the data is skewed. Now, let's see what happens when you look
into the sales column on the data set. This histogram looks pretty bell shaped,
and the QQ plot with this data confirms it. This time the quantiles are pretty
much aligned around the orange line, which suggests a Gaussian distribution for
the data.

>> So far, we looked at several examples. We've calculated the variance of
the covariance of joint distributions. We looked at the discrete joint
distributions with age of children and height, grades and naps and we got
the following variances and covariances. We also saw three different
games with the same variances, the same expectations and
covariance of 1 minus 1 and zero. And finally we looked at
the data set of waiting time and customer ratings and we noticed
that it has a negative covariance because the higher the waiting time,
the lower the ratings. So now what we want to do is we want to
put all these things together and imagine that we have a very large
data set with say five variables. How would the covariances work here? Well, we have the variance of
each one of them separately and the covariances of each of the pairs. So we would have ten pairs over here and
that's going to be the covariance matrix. So the covariance matrix simply
has the variances in the diagonal. That's the variance of x here,
the variance of y and the covariances on the antidiagonal. Capturing this in matrix form,
we'll look as follows. So for example, the covariance matrix of
this data set is this matrix over here. Covariance matrix is very, very useful in
statistics and also in machine learning. So let's look at the covariance matrix for
the age versus height one. It's going to be this matrix over here. Now let's look at the one for
the game examples. They are these two for games 1 and 2. And finally,
let's say we had three variables. So for a data set with three variables
we're going to have a 3 by 3 covariance matrix where in the main diagonal
we're going to have the variances. And in the other coordinates we're
going to have the corresponding covariances. So for example in the coordinate XY we're
going to have the covariance of XY. In the coordinates X set we have
the covariance of X set, etc. And again if we have five variables
then we're going to have a 5 by 5 covariance matrix where in the main
diagonal we have all the variances. And in the other places
we have the corresponding covariance of the row variable and
the column variable. This matrix is going to be called sigma,
the covariance matrix.

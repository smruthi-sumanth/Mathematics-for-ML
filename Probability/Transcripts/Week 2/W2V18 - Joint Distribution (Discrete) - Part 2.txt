Now let's throw two fair six sided dice. Let X be the discrete random variable that
indicates the number rolled on the first dice, and Y the one that indicates
the number rolled on the second dice. So the possible outcomes for
X and the possible outcomes for Y are all probability one-sixth,
and there are the numbers 123456. Let's put the probability mass function
of X and also of Y because they're the same thing over here,
all the probabilities are one-sixth. So we have X as the number
rolled on the first die and Y as the number rolled on the second dice. The individual PMFs for
each variable are as follows. And notice that X and
Y are independent variables. So for example, the probability that
X is 2 and Y is 5 is over here and it's going to be the product of the two
probabilities, one-sixth times one-sixth. And so it's 1 over 36. And that's going to happen for
all the pairs, because as we said, they're all independent. And so the probability mass function
is simply a table full of 1 over 36 all over the place. So in the formula, we have the following. The probability mass function
of XY is P(X=x, Y=y), which for independent discrete random
variables is the product of the two. This obviously is not going to be the case
all the time, but when the variables are independent, this is pretty simple
because the probability mass function for X and Y factors into the probability
mass function of x times the probability mass function of y. Now let's look at a more
complicated example. You again throw a fair six-sided dice. And now X is the discrete random variable
that indicates the number rolled on the first dice. So for example, here X is equal to 4 and Y is going to be another
discrete random variable. But this one's going to capture
the sum of the two dice. So if the first one is 4 and
the second one is 5, then Y is going to be 4+5 equals 9. So now let's look at this
joint probability function. So the probability mass function of X is,
again, the number roll in the first dice. And that one looks like this
because we already saw it. It's one-sixth for the values 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. What about the sum of both dice? Well, for
this one we have the entire table with the values of both die and
we have 2 for (1, 1). Then we have 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10, 11, and finally 12 for the value (6, 6). We can put these ones in a histogram too. Let's put them over here. The sum of dice is on the horizontal axis
and the count is on the vertical axis. So as you can see,
the sum that appears more often is 7, and the ones that appear
the least often are 2 and 12. Let's actually write the pair
of dice here in the histogram. And so that's our histogram for Y. Now let's look at the table of counts for
both X and Y. So on the horizontal axis we have x,
which is the value of the first die. And on the vertical we have y, which
is the sum of the values of both dice. And we're going to put
all these numbers here. So first we start with 1,1, which is here because the first
dice is 1 and the sum is 2. Then we have this one over here, 1, 2, which has the first dice,
is 1 and the sum is t3. And we can continue putting them here. As you can see, everyone is plotted on the
coordinates where the first coordinate is the value of the first dice and the second
coordinate is the sum of the two dice. Now, the counts are all
one because only one combination leads you to each
one of these blue boxes. So we have 36 possible outcomes. And when we divide by the sum, then we get
that the probabilities are all 1 over 36. And that is the joint distribution for
X and Y. Now using this distribution,
what is P(3,7)? For example,
the probability of X=3 and Y=7. Well, if X=3,
then it has to be on the third column. And if Y=7 then it has
to be on the 7th row. It's really just the numbers 3 and 4. And the probability of this is 1 over 36
because all of them are 1 over 36 or 0. What is the probability of 1,
1, for example, that the first die is 1 and the sum is 1? Well, that's impossible because
no dies can fall on a 0. And so that's shown over here,
it falls on a square that has a 0 on it. So that probability is 0. So this is the joint probability
distribution for the variables X and Y.

You have now learned how to find the expected value of
a random variable. But what if you are looking
for something different, perhaps the expected value of the square of
this variable or the cubed or any other
function. Let me show you how. Imagine that you have this probability
distribution and you get the outcome x_1 with
probability p(x_1), the outcome x_2 with
probability p(x_2). The outcome x_3 with probability
p(x_3) and the outcome x_4 with probability p(x_4). Now to find the expected value, you simply have to take
each outcome and multiply it by the probability and
add them all together. Now, if you wanted
the expected value of some function of x, what you do is you take
a function at each of the points and add them multiplied by each of
the probabilities. Let me give you an example. Imagine a game
that you play with a friend where you roll a dice and your friend doesn't
give you the amount of money for the number
that you roll, but the square of it. It's actually a
pretty good game. You get $1 if you roll a 1, but 2^2, $4, if roll a 2 and all
the way to 6^6, which is $36 if you roll a 6. What's the fair price
to play for this game? Well, you simply
take the average of the squares of
1,2,3,4,5 and 6. That's going to be
somewhere around here. What's this number? Well, it's 1+4+9+16+25+36/6,
which is 91/6. That means it's the
number over here. Notice that, that is
the sum of the squares of the values you're
getting divided by six, which is precisely
the expected value of the variable X^2. You not only can take expected
values of things like X, but you can also take
the expected value of X^2 or e^x or sine x or any function regarding
the random variable X

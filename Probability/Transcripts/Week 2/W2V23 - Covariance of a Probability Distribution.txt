Consider the following scenario. Players X and Y are playing three
games to either win or lose $1. In Game 1,
there are two possible outcomes. Both players win $1 each, or
both players lose $1 each. Here are the two possibilities, either
they both win $1 or they both lose $1. Where the horizontal coordinate
is how one player does, and the vertical coordinate is
how the other player does. And each one happens with probability 1/2. In Game 2, two things can happen. The first player can win a dollar and
the second one loses a dollar. Or the first one loses a dollar and
the second one wins a dollar. And we're calling these players X and
Y, remember? So X is the first player and
Y is the second player. The plot for this one is over here where
half the times it happens that one player wins a dollar and
the other one loses it. And the other half the time
one player loses a dollar and the other one wins it, and
both with probability 1/2. So recall that the X coordinate tells you
what the first player wins or loses and the Y coordinate what
the second one wins or loses. And in Game 3, more can happen. So actually, both players can win $1,
both players can lose $1. One player can win and
the other one loses. Or the other player wins and
the first one loses. So four possibilities, basically a,
b, c and d all with probability 1/4. So here is a question for you. How similar are these three games for
player X and for player Y? Well, let's examine them. And first we're going to
examine them independently. So X is how much money in
dollars player X wins and Y is how much money in
dollars player Y wins. So let's first look at how much
X makes in the first game. And as you may imagine,
it's going to be the expected value. And we're only looking at the horizontal
coordinate because we're looking at player one. So it can be winning a dollar
with probability 1/2 or losing a dollar with probability 1/2 and
that's 0. So the expected value for
the first player is 0. And the same thing for the second player. They win a dollar or
lose a dollar with probability 1/2. The same thing happens for
the second game. For the second game, for the first player, they can win a dollar or
lose a dollar, that's 0. And for the second player they can
win a dollar or lose a dollar. So again, it's 0. And so this game has the same expectancy
for the first and second player. Now the third game, let's take a look. Four things can happen. You can win a dollar or
win another dollar. Or you can lose a dollar or
lose another dollar. And that again adds to 0. And the same thing for the second player
they can win a dollar two times or lose a dollar two times,
all with the same probabilities. So these games are basically the same if
you only think of one player at a time. In terms of expectancy,
every player at the end of the day if they play many times they're
going to end up winning 0. And so these expectancies don't
really tell these games apart. Now what happens with the variance? Could it be that the variance can help us? Well, let's calculate the variance
of each of the games. For the first game this is
the calculation of the variance. Recall that the expected value is 0. So all we care is the expected value
of X1 squared and that's going to be 1. And I'll spare you of the calculations but it's actually going to be 1 for
all of these ones. So these games are pretty similar
in terms of expectancy and in terms of X variance and
in terms of Y variance. But obviously they are different games. However, where does the difference lie? The difference lies in that you have to
look at both players at the same time, otherwise the game is the same for
each player. For each player just win a dollar or
lose a dollar. So we need to look at the covariance. The covariance is going to
tell these three games apart. And recall that this was the formula for
the covariance of a data set and we're going to calculate it for
the three games. So let's do it for game 1. Here is X and Y. Now we center X and Y which nothing
changes because the mu of X and the mu of Y are 0. And when we multiply them,
look at what happens. We have a 1 and a 1 because
either they both win a dollar or they both lose a dollar. So the products are 1 and
when we add this we're going to get 2 and the average is going to be 1 because
we have to divide this by 2. So the covariance of the first game is 1. And the fact that the covariance is
positive shows this correlation here that the more player one wins,
the more player two wins. So either they both happy or
they both sad. Now let's look at Game 2 which
is the complete opposite. When one is happy the other one is sad and
one is sad, the other one is happy. Again, these are the means,
they're both 0 and in our table then either one wins one and
the other one loses one or vice versa. The product of these two things
is going to always be -1 because 1 times -1 is equal to -1 and
-1 times -1 equal to -1. So when we add them we get -2 and
when we take the average we get -1. So this one has a covariance of -1,
which is reflected in the fact that they kind of form this
pattern over this diagonal. And that means that either one is
happy and the other one is sad, or one is sad and the other one is happy. And finally, Game 3,
we're going to do the calculation. In Game 3, four things can happen. They both win, they both lose or one
wins and the other loses or vice versa. Again, we saw that the mu's are 0. So we're going to do this table where
these are the possible things that happen to X. These are the possible
things that can happen to Y. Centering makes no difference
because the means are 0. And when we multiply them,
we get two 1s and two -1s. We get all the possible four scenarios. This is going to be 0. And when we divide in order to
get the average, we get 0 again. So this covariance is 0. And that shows the fact that there's
not really a pattern among these. They have all the four possibilities. So we can't really infer if we
know that one player is happy, we don't know if the other one is happy or
sad. And vice versa because they
are more independent of each other. So in other words, we have these three
games, Game 1, Game 2 and Game 3. In Game 1they both win or
both lose at the same time. In Game 2 is more of a 0 sum game,
one wins and the other one loses. And in Game 3 anything can happen. And in the first game we
had a covariance of 1. In the second one a covariance of -1,
and in the third one a covariance of 0. Now let's introduce one more game, Game 4. Game 4 has the following three outcomes. Either both players win $1 each or
both players lose $1 each, or neither player wins nor loses anything. So these three things can happen. Both players win a dollar. Bost players lose a dollar and
nothing happens. But the probabilities are unequal, so the probability of both
players win a dollar is 1/2. The probability of both players
lose a dollar is 1/3 and the probability that
nothing happens is one 1/6. And these are illustrated over here. So now if we look at only one player,
the X player, what is the expected value of their game? Well, it's going to be the weighted
average of the values which is going to be 1/6. And the same thing for
the other player, it's going to be 1/6. So each player wins on average 1/6
every time they play this game. Now let's look at the variance. The variance is calculated like this. And we can do this calculation,
which is 1/2(1-1/6) square + 1/6(0-1/6) square + 1/3(-1)-1/6) square. Because we have to subtract mu and
then square and then multiply with the probabilities and
we get 0.806. So the X variance is 0.806. As you can imagine it's
the same as the Y variance. And what's the covariance? Well, let's calculate it. Now we used to say that the covariance was
the average of the product of coordinates but that's when we had
equal probabilities. That was way back in the day. Now we don't have equal probabilities,
we have that 1/2, 1/6 and 1/3. So what we have to do is
multiply by the probabilities. So this is what happens in general. You simply multiply by the probability
the product of the X coordinate and the Y coordinate. Covariance of (X,Y) can also
be expressed like this. Which is actually very similar to
the variance formula except you have a different X and Y. If you were to say covariance of XX you
get E[X] squared -E[X] all squared and that's the same as the variance. So if we're going to calculate this
we just do the probabilities times the X coordinate times the Y
coordinate after centering them. And recall that these are the means and
the variances. So we get this calculation over here. This over here is for the first point and the covariance XY is 0.806. So as you can see it's a positive
covariance because they win and lose together. So there's that sort of diagonal that
shows that the result of player can help us in further result of player B. Now let's go back to the example of
the phone calls with waiting time and customer rating. Recall that we had two marginal
distributions, X and Y and now we want to find the covariance. So I want you to try to guess do you think
this covariance is going to be positive or negative? And my guess is that it's going to be
negative because as you can see we have sort of a diagonal that goes down and
to the right. And that means negative covariance because
you can imagine that the more you wait the less rating you would put. And the less you wait the more
rating you would put. So these are inversely correlated and therefore the covariance is
probably going to be negative. But let's actually calculate it. When we find the expectation of XY, we find it to be 18.014 minus
the product of expectations of X and Y. And that's going to be -7.878. So indeed it is negative. Let me repeat this calculation for
clarity. Here is the formula for covariance and
here is what we've calculated to be the two expectations of X and
Y and the expectation of XY. So the covariance is simply
E(XY) -E(X)E(Y) that is -7.878.

So imagine a game where
you can do two things. First you flip a coin, and
if it lands on heads, you win $1, and otherwise you win nothing. And then after you flip the coin,
you roll a die, and you win the amount that you rolled. So here's a question, what is the expected
amount that you win for this game? Well, for the coin toss,
the expected value, we're going to call this variable X sub
coin, is one half, as you saw before. Because with a half probability you win
one, with half probability you win zero. So each time you play,
you're winning on average half a dollar. And for the second game, it's 3.5, because
that's the average of all these numbers. We're going to call X dice
the result of the second game. And E of X, which is the result
of both games at the same time, is going to be the sum of the expectations
of the coin game and the dice game. So it's going to be $0.5 + $3.5,
which is $4. And in general, if you have two variables
and you add them, the expectation of the sum of the variables is equal
to the sum of the expectations. Now, the sum of the expectations may
be something that seems very trivial, but actually it can get us to
some pretty nontrivial results. Let's look at the following game. You have a bunch of names corresponding
to all the people in the world. So since there's 8 billion people,
you have 8 billion names in a bag. And imagine that these are unique names. Everybody has name and last name and
just enough identifiers that each little piece of paper corresponds to one person
and only one person in the world. Now, I'm going to travel around
the world and grab out of this bag one little piece of paper and
give it to each person in the world. What is the expected number
of correct assignments? Now I want you to take a guess here. What is the expected number of people that
are going to get their own name if we play this game with all
the people in the world? And believe it or not, the answer is 1. So there's going to be very
likely 1 person, Bo Bleepityblop, who's going to be given their own name. Now, why is this the case? Let me show you in the next video. So let's play the game, but for only
three people, Aisha, Beto, and Cameron. So we have the three people, and
the three names on the bag, and we're going to start giving
them to the three of them. So let's say we give this person
Beto's name, and we were wrong, because that was Cameron. And we give this person Aisha's name, so
we were correct, because that's Aisha. And then we give this person
Cameron's name, and we were wrong. So this time,
we got one right and two wrongs. Now let's play this game many times,
and six possible things can happen, and they're mentioned here. These are the six different ways that I
can give these three people the three names in the bag, and
each one has the same probability. So let's count how many
times we are correct. So if we do the first assignment,
we're correct three times. If we do the second assignment,
we're correct one time, for the third, we're correct one time. For the next two, we're not correct
at all, and for the last one, we're correct one time. And this is because for the first
one we got the three names correct. For the second, we got Aisha, for the
third we got Cameron, for the sixth one, we got Beto correctly, and for
the others we got them all wrong. So we need to find
the average of these numbers, that is the expected number of people
we're going to get correct at this game. Now the sum, 3 +1 +1 +1 is 6,
and 6 divided by 6, which is the total number of times we
play the game, is 1, so the average is 1. So for three people, the expected number
of correct assignments is going to be 1. Now we can do the same thing for
8 billion people. Of course, this is going to be a pretty
difficult average to calculate, because there's going to be a lot
of possibilities for that game. Is there anything simpler that we can do? So it turns out that yes,
there is something simpler we can do for this calculation, and let me show you. It's going to be a little
counterintuitive, but it works really well, and it's going to
be using the sum of expectations. So let's call Matches the random variable
that counts the number of matches in this game. And we want to find that
the expected number of matches is 1. Now let's split it into several things. Let's call A the number of correct
assignments that only matter to Aisha. So the number of times that
Aisha is given her own name. Now, because she can be given
the three possible names, then what is E of A, the expectation of A? Well, each name is given to her
with probability one-third. Therefore, each time we play this game, on average she gets her name
correct one-third of the time. Therefore E of A is one-third. We can do the same thing with Beto. And the expected value of the number of
assignments that get his name correct is one-third. And with Cameron, we do the same thing. The expected number of assignments that
get their name correctly is one-third. And because the number of matches is
equal to the number of matches with Aisha plus the number of matches with Beto
plus the number of matches with Cameron, then their expected
values also add together. So therefore, expected number of matches
is a third plus a third plus a third, which is 1. And that's another way to see that
the expected number of matches is going to be 1. Now, that technique is simpler, because now we can use it with
every person in the world. We have 8 billion people, we're going to
play this game with all of them. And as I told you before, the expected
number of matches is going to be 1, but why? Well, let's say that we have all
the people, called person 1 all the way to person n, where n is 8 billion, or
the number of people in the world. And the number of matches is going
to be the number of matches for person 1 plus the number of matches for
person 2, etc, plus the number of matches for
person 8 billion. And now the expected number of matches
is equal to be then sum of all those expectations. Now, the expectation for
each one of these is 1 over n. Because, let's say, if you are one person, the probability that you get
your correct name is 1 over n. So the expected number of times you
get your name correctly is 1 over n. And when we add these together,
we're adding 1 over n n times. So 1 over 8 billion, 8 billion times,
and this number is 1. Because, in general,
you have that the expected value of a sum of n variables is the sum
of their expected values. So as you can see, this property that
the expected value is at is pretty simple, but it can also be pretty powerful.

So now that you know joint distributions, let me introduce you to two
very important concepts, the concept of the marginal distribution
and the conditional distribution. Let's go back to the age and
height example. Imagine that I have a full distribution of
ages and heights of the populations, but all of a sudden I don't
care about age anymore, I just want the distribution of heights. What I have to do is
aggregate over all the ages. And now I have what's called
a marginal distribution. Another thing I can do is take slices. For example, I have the full
distribution of age and height. And let's say I now only care about the
height distribution of people of age 30, for example. So what I do is I take a slice and that
is called the conditional distribution. Let me show you more. So recall this data set
of children with ages and height from which we generated
a joint distribution, as shown here. Now, what if all of a sudden we
didn't care about age anymore and we only cared about height? So we wanted to summarize the behavior of
the distribution across only the height variable. In order to do this, we need to find what's called
the marginal distribution of height. It's really just the distribution of
one variable while completely ignoring the other one. These are useful for summarizing
the behavior of one variable at a time. So to find the marginal distribution for
the heights, we simply add over each height
value all the probabilities. So in other words,
we are adding each column and that value corresponds
to each of the heights. So for example, for
45 it's 1/10, for 46, it's 2/10, so 47, it's 2/10, for 48 is zero,
because the column is all zero. For 49 is 3/10, and for
50 is 1/10 plus 1/10, which is 2/10. And the formula is over here Py (yj), where yj is the sum of all Pxy(xiyj). That's the same as saying that we're
taking the sum over each column. So here's a small quiz. Let's find the formula for Py(50). And the formula is the sum
over all this column. So it's basically the sum
over I of Pxy(xi,50). And it's actually two divided by ten,
because that's the sum of that column. Now, let's say we care about age,
so we forget about the height and we want to find the distribution of age. The formula is very similar,
we're adding over every row and we obtain 3/10, 2/10,
4/10 which is 3/10 plus 1/10. And the formula is Px(xi) equals
the summation over all j, that's the element in the row of
the corresponding probability of xi,yj. So for example, what is Px(7)? Well, it's going to be 3/10 because
it's the sum of that entire row. Now, this probability distribution right
here is the marginal distribution for age, and this one is the marginal
distribution for height. Now, let's expand the data
set to 50 children. And this is the corresponding
scattered plot. Notice that there is shading in
the plots because there may be more than one child here. So more children are 10 and
50 inches tall, hence the darkest spot, compared to the one over here,
with age eleven and 62 inches tall. Overlaying the plot, with a heat grid,
we can clearly see sections where there are more counts of children for
a specific data point. The marginal age will be obtained by
summing across the vertical axis, and those for height will be obtained by
summing across the horizontal axis. So earlier we saw an example where X
was the number roll on the first die and Y the number roll on the second one. And we have this joint probability where
it's a table full of one 1/36 like this. When we want to generate
the marginal one over X, we simply add over every row and
we get 1/6 and the margin over Y. Same thing, we get a bunch of 1/6. And that's what we started with, right? Because originally we said that
the probability of each value is 1/6 for the first and for the second dice. But now let's look at a slightly more
complicated one, the one where X was the number roll on the first dice and
Y was the sum of the two dice. For this one,
we have this distribution over here. Now, let's say that we want
to aggregate over the rows, because now we want the distribution for
the sum of the two dice. So we add over the rows and
we get the values 1/36, 2/36, et cetera, et cetera,
all the way to 1/36 again. And the histogram is like this, because many more pairs add to seven
than they add to, say, two or three. So the formula is this one over here. And let's see,
what do you think is Py(10)? Well, when we add over the 10th row,
we get 3/36. So the probability that the sum
of two dies is ten is 3/36. This is something we saw a while ago,
but now we went to two variables and then back to one. And this is the histogram for
only the distribution Y, which is obtained from that table. Let's go back to the call center example,
where we had time on the horizontal axis and the customer rating
on the vertical axis. And recall that we can find
two marginal distributions. The one for waiting time, which is
obtained by aggregating over every column, and the one for rating, which is
obtained by aggregating over every row. Now, recall that with marginal
distributions the goal is to reduce a highly dimensional distribution
into one of less dimensions. In other words, here we have a two
dimensional one, which has two variables and we want to bring it back
to one dimension, that's one variable. So how do we reduce this in, for example,
the time dimension for waiting time? Well, we sum up all the probabilities
along the waiting time axis and we get a histogram similar to this, which actually gives us this
probability distribution. So that's the slice that we
take if we cut that graph with a plane parallel to the waiting time axis.

So the variance is a pretty useful way
to measure the spread of a distribution. However, it has one small drawback,
the units. Imagine if your distribution has,
for example, the height of people. So, these heights are measured
in meters or feet, and the expected value is also
measured in meters or feet. However, the variance is measured
in meters squared or feet squared. And this is not useful. So what do we do? We take the square root,
we call that the standard deviation. So the standard deviation is a pretty
useful way to measure the spread of a distribution using the same
units of the distribution. So, as we saw, the variance is the expected value of X
minus the mean squared, which can also be written as the expectation of X squared
minus the squared of the expectation of X. Now, here's a small problem. Say that X is measured in meters. Maybe it's height, or some length. Then expected value of X
is measured in meters. So it would tell us, for example, the average of the height
of the people we're measuring. So it's in the same units as
the variable that we're measuring. However, look at the variance. The expectation of X squared
is in meters squared, and the expectation of X all squared
is also in meters squared. So the variance of X is
measured in meters squared. And that's not so useful. Imagine if we're measuring people's
heights and the variance tells you something in meters squared which
measures area, so that's not so useful. What can we do? Well, a simple solution is to just take
the square root of the variance of X and that is now measured in meters. So let's call that
the standard deviation of X. The standard deviation is the square
root of the variance of X. Now, in the normal distribution,
the standard deviation is very useful. Let's take a look at this bell's shaped,
and remember that when we defined it, it had two parameters mu. Which was the center of the bell,, or the
mean, or the expected value, and sigma, which was the spread of the bell,
or the standard deviation. And the formula was this one over here
that we saw in the previous week. Well, a good visual cue
to determine the value of sigma is where the bell
starts changing concavity. And at that point, you are at
mu plus sigma or mu minus sigma, depending on where you're standing and how much of the area is between
mu plus sigma and mu minus sigma. Well, it turns out that 68% of
the area is in between those two. And when you look at mu plus 2 sigma or
mu minus 2 sigma, so the area between two standard deviations
of the mean in both directions, there's actually 95% of the curve here. And if you look at three standard
deviations, 99.7 of the curve is there. So, to be more exact, 68.2 lies in
between one standard deviation. In these little two strips over here,
between one and two standard deviations, there's 13.5%. And in the next ones, there's 2.35%. And in the tails, which extend infinitely,
but they're still very, very tiny, there's a 0.15% of the area. And in statistics, it's very common
to talk about being within 1 or 2 or 3 standard deviations of
the mean when you're talking about a normal distribution.

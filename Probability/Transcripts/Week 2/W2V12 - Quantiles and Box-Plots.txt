You've learned several ways to
describe your data numerically. But for a data scientist, it's tremendously important to be
able to visualize the data correctly. In this video, I'm going to show you
several ways for visualizing data. So let's begin by considering a data set. We're considering an advertising sales
data set and the newspaper ad budget. So if you took course two
from this specialization, you're already familiar with it. This dataset showed the newspaper TV and
radio budgets and the sales revenues generated. For simplicity, let's consider only twelve
samples from the newspaper ad budget. From this small sample,
you may want to infer the median. Remember, the median is the point
that splits your data in half. So first you will need to sort
the observed values in increasing order. And then since you have twelve
data points, then you can evenly split the data set into these two
halves with six samples each. And the median is simply the average
of the two values in the middle. That is 27.8. We call that the 50% quantile or
the second quartile. And those names will make
more sense in a minute. So what about the point that leaves one
quarter of the data to the left and three quarters to the right, or
in other words, the average of these two? Well, that's 18.35 and that's the 25%
quantile or the first quartile. We call it Q1. So it's kind of like the median, but
it doesn't cut it into half, but into one quarter three quarters. And we can call it little Q of 0.25 or
big q of one for first quartile. And in general, you can do this for
any percentage. The k% quantile is the value that
leaves k% of your data to the left and 100 minus k% of the data to the right. And we just denote it as
little q of k divided by 100. And some common quantiles are the 25% one,
the 50% one, and the 75% one. The 25% one, as you saw,
is the first quartile, Q1. The 50% quantile is the median,
which is Q2, and the 75% quantile is the third quartile,
which is Q3. So let's say your data
set has n points and N sub k correspond to
the first k percent of data. So for example,
n20 here is the first 20% of data and n100 minus n20 is
the last 80% of the data. Then we have that 20 divided
by 100 is N sub 20 over N. And that's the probability
that the variable you're measuring x is below
the k percent quantile. In this case is q 0.2 because that's 20%. And what we're doing is suppose that
your data follows some distribution and that has a PDF which looks
like the blue curve. So then the area under that curve for
the k percent quantile, in this case the 20% quantile
should be k over 100. And so if you're computing
quantiles from distributions, you can say that the k percent
quantile is simply the value, such that the probability of the variable
being below Q is simply k over 100.

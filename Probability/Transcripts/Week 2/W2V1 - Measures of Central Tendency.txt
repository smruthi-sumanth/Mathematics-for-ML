Welcome to Week 2. In the first week, you learned about probability distributions. This week, you're going
to learn about some ways for describing the data and these probability
distributions. You're going to see
how mean, median, and mode describe the
center of the distribution and how variance describes the spread of the distributions. You will also be introduced to the concept of unexpected value. You're going to see that
expected values can be used to describe some interesting
properties of variance, as well as some
advanced properties of probability distributions such
as skewness and kurtosis. So far you've seen
probability distribution of one random variable. But in Lesson 2 of this week, you're going to learn
probability distributions of more than one
random variable. Some concepts you'll learn
are joint distribution, marginal distribution, conditional distributions,
and covariance. These are very
useful to describe probability distributions
in multiple variables. Let's get started. Let's look
again at the example where you had a bunch of kids
with different ages. How would you figure out what is the average age of a
kid in this group? Well, you have three
kids of Age 0, two kids of Age 1, four kids of Age 2, and one kid at Age 3. Now if you don't have
any mathematical tools, you can use a simple trick. You can look at
this histogram as a distribution and you try
to balance it on a scale. The point where it balances is actually the average
age of a kid. Now because kids
of different ages weigh different amounts less, replace them all with
equally sized balls. Now you just have a bunch
of balls and you can put them on a scale and
find a tipping point. By trial and error, you can find that the scale is balanced somewhere here at
a value of 1.3. Let's try to actually calculate
this number, this 1.3. The easiest way to
calculate it is just a sum all the kids ages and divide
by the total number of kids. This way you get the
average age of the kids and that is exactly point where you have to
balance your scale. You have three kids of Age 0, two kids of Age 1, four kids of Age 2
and one kid of Age 3. The sum of these numbers
divided by 10 is 13/10, and that is 1.3. 1.3 is the average age and also the point where
the scale would balance. Now notice that
this last equation looks a lot like probabilities. If you take each number and
divide it by 10 and add them, then you have numbers
like 1/10, 2/10, 3/10. Let's say you have a
3/10 probability that the age of the kid is zero
2/10 that the age is 1, and 4/10 that's the age is 2, and 1/10 that's the age is 3. Adding those
probabilities, you get 1.3 if you add them for
each one of the kids. That's something very special about the average that
we're going to see next. Now let's go back to the phone center example
from the previous videos. When you had a sample of data, let's say you want
to find the mean. You can imagine that each of
these bars on the plot has its own weight and
what you need to do is balance them on a scale, just I get balanced the
balls in the previous video. For this case if balance is somewhere around where
the triangle is, and that's exactly where
the mean of your sample is. Now we can again go
closer and closer to a continuous distribution like we did in the
previous week. You can always talk about the distribution
of the sample more precisely and you can
always break down the intervals into smaller ones. For finding mean, this
makes no difference. You still have to simply balance the left
and the right side. When you're going to
talk about the mean of a continuous distribution, you don't have to take averages, but you can see it as the point where you
would balance the curve. If you think about it, that's
a bit like the amount of time you would expect the
call to take on average. We're going to see
more of that later. You've seen the mean before, but let me show you
an example where the mean may not work so well. In the 1980s, the starting salary for
a geography graduate of the University of North
Carolina was actually $250,000. Sounds like a very big salary. Especially considering that for the rest of the United States, the starting salary for a
geography graduate was $22,000. Why do you think this happened? Well, it could have been
another program was excellent, although I'm sure there were
other excellent programs too. That may not be it. Could it be that
the university had great connections but I'm sure other universities also have great connections.
Maybe that's not it. Or perhaps it was the one
student made a lot of money. That was indeed the case. Michael Jordan graduated from the Geography Program at the University of North
Carolina in the 80s. He went out and made
a lot of money. He brought the average
up for everybody. It's not really that
the average student was making a lot of
money is that he was making so much money that it looked like they
were all making money. But the average here
is a little deceiving. Here's a plot that shows us
why the average is deceiving. Imagine that this
is the histogram of the salaries Salary is in the horizontal axis
and the number of students with that salary
in the vertical axis. If you were to balance it, it goes over here
around $22,000. However, Michael Jordan is all the way here.
Then what happens? He tips the scale and
in order to balance it, we have to move it up. He brings the average
up for everybody and the average is no
longer measuring what the average
student makes it got skewed by that one
point on the right. How can we fix that? Well, let's consider
a different metric. Let's actually put them
all in order by salary. Now it's just a
position that matters. Once we do that, we can pick the number in
the very middle. The salary in the very
middle is the median. Notice that that is
no longer so high because now Michael
Jordan doesn't contribute a lot of money, he just contributes one
person to this list. That is the median. Now, if the median were
to be in the middle because you have an
even number of points, then you simply
take the average of the two points in the middle. The moral here is, when the average is deceiving, go for the median
and you may get a better idea of your data. There's one more way to
describe the center of a distribution apart from the mean and the median
and it's called the mode. Remember our call center example where the probability
or the operator picks up the phone in a given time looks
something like this, mode is simply the
value at which the distribution has the
highest probability, which makes it the
most frequent one. For example, in this case, it's this number over here. You can see that
it's the outcome with the highest probability. The same thing happens here in the more granular
discrete distribution. It's the point where the
tower is the highest. For a continuous distribution, the mode is simply the value
that has the highest height. Now, the mode may not be unique. You may be in a
distribution like this where the
maximum value gets repeated many times and that's called a multimodal
distribution. In places like the uniform
distribution for example, everything is a mode. In summary, you have the mean, the median, and the mode. It's always good to look at
the three of them in order to really see where the
center of your data is. Now let's look at
a real example, the binomial distribution. Here's an example of five trials with a probability of 1/2, like flipping five fair
coins. What does this mean? Well, remember that we used a scale to balance distribution. In the scalar distribution, it's pretty simple to find the balance and it's
perfectly symmetric. It's over here. The mean is at a value of 2.5. Now what about the median? Well, same thing as the average of two
values in the middle, because we have an
even number of values. It's also 2.5. What
about the modes? Well, the highest points in
distribution are 2 and 3. The modes are 2 and 3. Now let's look at an asymmetric
normal distribution. Flip a coin five
times and this time the probability of heads is 0.3. You're going to balance
them to scale and find out that it's here at 1.5. That is the mean. As the blue line shows, median is we're half a data to the right and half
the data to the left. That one is over here. Mode is again the outcome
with the highest probability, so it's going to be one. Now let's look at a
continuous example, the normal distribution.
What's the mean? Well, the mean is the
center because that's where you would balance the distribution as it's
perfectly symmetrical. What about the median? Well, the median is also
that point in the middle. The mode is also that
point in the middle, which is the highest one. For a normal distribution,
they all match

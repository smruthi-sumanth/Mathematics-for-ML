Let's go back to the example of two variables, age and height. Each distribution has
its own expected value and its own variance. But there's something here
that we haven't captured, which is the relation
between the two. As you can imagine, age and height are somewhat related because the
older someone is, the taller they are
or similar things. How do we capture that? We captured with a
very important concept called covariance. There's
also another concept called correlation. This
is what you're going to learn in this video.
Sometimes we want to know how two random variables are
related to each other. Having a good understanding
of these relations helps us build accurate models
and make better decisions. Consider the discrete
random variable X, which is the age of a child, and let's consider three
random discrete variables. Y_1 is the height of
the child in inches, Y_2 are the grades in
some particular test, and Y_3 is the number
of naps per day. We're given some
data as follows. The question is, how is
X compared to any of the three y-variables and how do you compare
these relations? To help us better
visualize what's going on in each of these data sets, let's actually
generate scatter plots for each where the
horizontal axis is X and the vertical
axis is Y_1, Y_2 or Y_3. The first plot is like this, the second one is like this and the third one is like this. I'm sure you can start
seeing some pattern. How do you think these relate? Well, first let's
look at some metric. For the age versus height one, we can look at
both of the means, the mean of the age, which is 10.5 and the mean
of the heights, which is 60. That's this point in the middle. The 10.5, 60 is the point where you
would balance these points. For age versus grades, it's this point in
the middle where mean of X is 10.5 again, and the mean of Y is five. For this one over here, age versus naps per day
is 10.5 for the age and 3.7 naps per day as an average. Now we can also look
at the variances. Let's look at the X variance, which means we forget
about the Y-coordinate and calculate the
three variances, which are 9.17 because it's
the same data-set for ages. Now let's look at the Y-coordinates only and
calculate the three variances, which are 39.56, 9.78 and 7.57. We have some information about each of the means and
each of the variances. However, I'm sure you see
something else going on. The age versus height one, is almost a diagonal that
goes up to the right. The age versus naps is
the opposite it goes to the bottom and the age versus grades is all over the place. That can be captured in something
called the co-variance. The co-variance of the first
plot is bigger than zero, the covariance of the
second plot is almost zero, and the covariance of the
third plot is less than zero. The covariance talks about
the relation between the two. As you can imagine, the
older the child is, the more height they have and that explains
the first plot. Age and grades seem to
not be very related. You can be older, young, and have
high or low grades, but they're not related and age and naps per
day are the opposite. The older you are as a kid, the less naps you're
going to have per day. That's what covariance
really summarizes. Now, how do we
calculate covariance? Well, the first
step is as usual, to center the graphs. Let's actually subtract the mean of X from the x coordinates
and the mean of Y for the y coordinates in order to get this center point
to be at the origin. Then let's also divide by the standard deviation of x
and of y in order to have this really nice plots where the X variance and the Y
variance are both one. Now that we have that, let's try to cook
up a formula that captures this trend over here
and this trend over here, and the lack of
trends in the middle. What would this formula be? Well, let's look at
the plot in the left. It seems that when you
move to the right, the coordinates move up
and the one in the middle, there seems to be no rule
and on the one on the right, if you move to the right,
the coordinates move down. Let's try to capture
this as some numbers that could be
positive or negative. Let's look at age versus height. When you move to the right by x, you move up by y and when
you move to the left by x, you move down by a quantity y. The quantities always
have the same sign. If I move to the right on some sign, positive or negative, then the points move up or down by the same
sign, positive or negative. Let's look at the coordinates
and the points in the left. Some of them have a
positive x coordinate and also a positive y-coordinate
and some of them have a negative x-coordinate and
also a negative y-coordinate. In other words coordinates of x and y tend to be the same sign, maybe not for every point, but for the majority
the coordinate of x and the coordinate of
y are the same sign. The opposite things
happen on the left graph. When you have a
negative x coordinate, you have a positive y-coordinate and when you have a
positive x coordinate, then you have a
negative y-coordinate, so they tend to have
a different sign. For the age versus grade ones, the one in the middle,
nothing seems to happen. Sometimes the x coordinate is positive and the y
one is positive, but sometimes the x one is negative and the y
one is positive. It seems like a
land with no rules. Anything can happen here. Now let's look at the
product of coordinates, because on the left, the coordinates normally
have the same sign, so the product of coordinates is normally
a positive number. On the one on the right, the coordinates normally
have a different sign, so their product is a
negative number because positive times
negative or negative times positive is negative. For the one in the middle, well, we can have both
positive numbers and negative numbers because
anything can happen. Now, what if I were to add all these products of
coordinates for each number? Well, in the left I'm going
to get something positive, in the right, I'm
going to get something negative and in the middle, I may get something
close to zero, maybe positive or negative, but probably close
to zero because I'm adding things that also
cancel with others. This sum is called
the co-variance. We get to the important
formula here, which is co-variance
is going to tell us if one variable
makes the other one grow or makes it decrease, or if it doesn't do anything
to the other variable. But it's not exactly the
sum of the products x, y, it's almost that. It's actually this number. First you have to center
the data and then you take the average of
all these products. Co-variance is going to
be the one to tell us if the first variable makes the other one grow such
as age and height, if the first variable does
nothing to the other variable, which is age and grades or if the first variable makes the
second variable decrease, like age and naps per day. Now led to some calculations. Here is the table
of age and height, which we call it had a
co-variance bigger than zero. This is the mean of ages
and the mean of heights. What we're going to do is
first center the data. Let's subtract the mean of age from all the
ages and the mean of heights from all
the heights and then multiply these two
columns to get this. When we added and
take the average, we get 170/10, which is 17. This covariance is 17
because the data is positively correlated
in the sense that when age grows,
height grows. Now let's do age
and naps per day. That's the one that was
negatively correlated. It has covariance negative. Here's again, the Mu
of x, the Mu of y. Here's age, here's naps, here's the centered age and
the centered naps per day and the product of these two columns is
this as you can see, all the numbers are negative, is a sum of -74.5. When we take the average, we divide by 10 because
there's 10 kids. We get a covariance of -7.45. That is negative
because as you know, the higher the age,
the less naps per day. Finally, we can do the
covariance formula for the age versus
grades distribution. Here are all the numbers. The age, the grades, the centered age,
the centered grades, the product of the two centered coordinates and that
sum is going to be one. When we divide by 10, we get the covariance
is 1/10 or 0.1, which is very close to zero. One of them doesn't have
influence over the other one, or at least very
little influence for the fact that the
covariance is very small. A small summary. We have three pairs
of variables. The ones that grow together have a positive covariance of
17 age versus height, the ones that look
independent from each other have a covariance of 0.1 are very small and
the ones that seem to be negatively correlated
have a covariance of -7.45, which is less than zero

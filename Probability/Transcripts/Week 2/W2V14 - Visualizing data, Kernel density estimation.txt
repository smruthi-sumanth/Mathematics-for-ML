Now, let's go back to the
advertisement example. All these samples
seem to come from a continuous random variable. You know by now that you can describe your data
distribution for continuous variables with the probability density
function or PDF. The question is, can
we gain any idea of what the PDF looks
like from the data? Well, I'm sure you're already
familiar with histograms. Since doing a histogram in just 12 values doesn't
make much sense, let's plot the histogram
for the whole dataset. Technically, a
histogram satisfies all the conditions of
a density function. It's positive and the area
under the curve is one. However, it's not a great
approximation for one. PDFs are usually
a smooth function and also the discontinuities of the bars appear from
the technique used to compute histograms and
not from the data itself. In other words, the actual
distribution where these come from may have a pretty
smooth density function. But since we're
taking a histogram, it looks like it
has a lot of peaks. Is there any way we can approximate the PDF of our
data from this histogram? It turns out there
is and the method is called kernel
density estimation. We start by making our
observations in a graph. Then you want each point
of a dataset to have an effect that spreads around
the observation point. Because we want high
density where there's a lot of points and low density
where there's no points. Let's put a little mountain
in each of the points. That means a small
Gaussian curve on top of each data point. This is called the kernel. You could choose other
functions than the Gaussian, but we're not going
to get into that. Now, the standard deviation
of the curve will determine how far the effect
of each point spreads. It could be thin or
it could be wide. Now, let's get back
to the original plot. Lastly, all you have to
do is multiply everything by one over n and sum
all the blue curves. Notice that since the area
under each curve is one, the avenue of the
curves must give us an area under the curve of one. This is what estimation looks like after cleaning
up the plot a bit. Doesn't look so great, but that's because you've
tried to approximate the density from
just 12 data points. But if you try for many points, then you're actually
going to get a really nice smooth
function that actually resembles a PDF well. This is a way to approximate
the PDF based on the data.

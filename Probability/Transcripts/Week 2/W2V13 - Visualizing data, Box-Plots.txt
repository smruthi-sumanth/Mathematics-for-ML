Now, there's a cool visualization called
the box plot or the box and whiskers plot, which is a standardized way of displaying
the distribution of your data based on five statistics the minimum, the maximum,
the median, the first quartile, and the third quartile. Let's see how it works using our
newspaper advertisement example. So, to create a box plot,
you need to calculate the three quartiles. That means, the 25% one,
the 50% one, and the 75% one. So let's divide the data into
four blocks of the same size. The first quartile, as you saw,
is the midpoint between 18.3 and 18.4. The second one is the midpoint
between 25.9 and 29.7. And the third one is the midpoint
between 51.2 and 54.7. Those are the three quartiles. Now we're going to call
the interquartile range ask Q3- Q1. That's where 50% of your data lies,
and that's 34.6, that's that difference between those two. And we're going to look
also at the minimum and maximum values of the data set. The minimum is 8.7 and the maximum is 75. And we're going to put
all of that in one plot. So let's start with the box. It should go from the first
to the third quartile, that's from 18.35 all the way to 52.95. Then we draw a line at the value
of the median 27.8, that's Q2. Now it's time to draw the whiskers. For this you draw two lines
going from the end of the box until Q1 -1.5 times
the interquartile range, which is the height of that orange box and
one going from Q3+ 1.5 times the interquartile range,
which is Q3-Q1. However, the whiskers should
never go beyond the max and the minimum values of the data set. So if that happens, like in this example,
simply cut the whisker at those values. Now the box plot is very useful, because just by looking at the plot you
can get plenty of insight on your data. In this case, you can easily see that the data is skewed
because Q3-Q2 is way bigger than Q2-Q1. For this small case, we can see
that there are no extreme points or outliers since both whiskers
end at the max and min values. If there are any values that
are outside of the whiskers, then we say that those are outliers,
they're too far from the center. Now the length of the box and the whiskers allow you to analyze
the dispersion of the data. Now let's take a look at the box plot
obtained using all the data sets. For this,
you need all the values of Q1, Q2, Q3, the interquartile range, and
the minimum and the max. The minimum is 0.3 and the max is 114. With these values,
you get these box plots. So these are the Q1, Q3, and Q2. Notice that the bottom whisker
goes from Q1 to the smallest value of the data set 0.3,
while the upper whisker actually ends in 93.626,
which is 1.5 times the IQR. This leaves two data points outside of the
whisker, which are considered outliers.

So finally, I want to show you
one last visualization tool. These are called Violin Plots and
are widely used in Data Science. What's so cool about violin plots? It contains the information of both
the kernel density estimation and the box plots. Really, all you do is you put
the kernel density estimation here at the side of the box plot. Let me be more specific. The violin plot looks like this. Here you have the KDE curve,
the kernel density estimation. Here you have the mean. Here you have the quartiles and
here you have the whiskers. So that is the violin plot. And as you can see, it's pretty useful.

Here's a question
for you. If you have a any probability distribution
discrete or continuous, and you are to draw a
random sample from it, what do you expect this
sample to be on average? This is called the
expected value. That's what we're going
to see in this video. Imagine you're going
to play a game with a friend where you flip a coin and if it lands on heads, you win $10 and otherwise
you win nothing. Let's assume that it's
a perfectly fair coin of 50/50 chance. Now, your friend
wants you to pay six dollars every time
you play the game. Would you play the
game at this price? Now what if your
friend wants you to pay four dollars instead? Would you play the game then? What is the maximum
amount of money you would pay to play this game? Well, how can you
figure this out? What is the fair price
to play for the game? You can think of this in
terms of probabilities. You can think of
what's likely to happen in the long-term. It's actually the
same calculation you did for the previous
video with the kids. For the long-term, you expect to get half of the times $10 and half of
the times zero dollars. Imagine if you played
this game 1,000 times, you're expecting roughly
500 times you're going to win $10 and 500 times
you're going to win zero. On average, you're
expecting to make five dollars every time
you play the game. We call that the expected value and we denoted by the letter E. E(x)=5 if you're expecting to win five dollars
on average at this game. That means that five dollars is the fair price to pay
for playing this game. You can look at it in
a plot like this one. If you have half
of a probability at $10 and another half
probability at zero, where would you balance
this distribution? You would balance
it exactly at five. The expected value and the
mean are the same thing and they're both the price that you would pay for
playing this game. Now let's think of another game. Now you flip three
coins and you win one dollar for each of the
coins that lands in heads. What is the price that you
would pay to play this game? Well, let's look at the entire distribution
that you've seen before. You can arrange the
possibilities by the number of heads and
create a histogram like this, just like we did before. Except that now on the left, you make zero dollars
for the next column, you make one dollar, for the next one you
make two dollars, and for the last one
you make three dollars. Where would you balance this? You would balance it right
in the middle at the 1.5. Therefore, the expected
value of this variable x, where the variable x
is the amount of money you're making in this game is going to be 1.5 or
in other words, on average, you're going to
be making $1.5 at every game. Notice that you're never
going to be making 1.5. You make 0, 1, 2 or 3, but on average,
you're making 1.5. Now, you can think about
this problem different. If you flip three coins and
half of them are heads, then what's half of three? That's the 1.5. That's the expected value. Now let's look at
another example. Imagine that you're rolling
a dice and you would like to know what the expected
value of the roll, so you have a fair die
with six sides and a probability of 1/6 that it
lands on each of the sides. How do you calculate
the expected value? Well, you have six events that are equally likely
so you can add them all together and then divide by the number of
possibilities, which is six. The answer is 3.5. If you were to balance
all these in a scale, then you would balance
it exactly at 3.5. That's the expected value. If you were to play a game
where you roll a dice and you make the
amount of dollars that's on the dice
that you rolled, then the fair price to pay
for this game would be 3.5. Now, let's look at the expected value of a
uniform random variable. Let's say that you're
taking the bus every day, and you look at how much time
the bus takes to arrive. Let's say the first time it took 15 minutes and so I'm going
to plot this number here. You continue collecting
data points because you take the bus every single day. You take it on the next day, and it took, let's
say 32 minutes. You keep recording every day and you keep collecting
data points. Now, you want to find the average of these
numbers because you want to find the average time that you
spend waiting for the bus. The average of those numbers is 27.833 and that's where you balance these
points over here. Now you can continue
collecting data points every single day that you take the bus and you get
something like this, and you're expecting that
if you're not really planning to take it
at a particular time, and let's say it
arrives every hour then roughly you're going to
get a uniform distribution, and the average is going
to be somewhere around 30. Why is it 30? Because
the distribution for the time that you
spent waiting for the bus is uniform
because as you can see, the point can land pretty much anywhere in that
interval equally. Where would you balance a uniform distribution
between zero and one? You would balance it in
the very middle at 0.5. For a uniform distribution
between a and b, then you're balancing
in the middle, which is the point a+b/2. Now let's do the same
thing with the phone. Let's say you call and this is the amount of time
that you wait, because the distribution of
time is this one over here, which is higher at the
point in the middle. If you continue
making many calls and checking how long
the calls take, then you notice that it's distributed with that
blue distribution. What would the mean be? Well, again, it
would be the point where you can balance
that distribution. The mean of a distribution or the expected value of the
distribution is the point where you can balance and
that's what you would expect to wait if you make a call
based on this distribution. Now, here's a common
misconception. It's common to think
that the mean is a place where the data is split in half. But that's not the case here. Notice that 50% data's here
and the other 50% is here, and the mean is not the
point in the middle. It's actually a
little to the right. Why is this? Well,
is because the data is more spread
to the right. The mean is actually here, and there's more orange area
than there is yellow area. That's okay. The reason is that even though we
have more mass here, here it's more spread out. I like to imagine this
with an extreme example. Let's say that I have
an elephant really, really close to the
balancing point and a mouse that is many
kilometers away. Well, because the
mouse is so far, even though it's much
smaller and lighter, it's still balances the
weight of the elephant. Even though the
elephant has more mass, the mouse is much,
much farther away.

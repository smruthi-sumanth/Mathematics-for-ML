So let's go back to our running example. I'm trying to estimate the average
height of the world's population. So I take a small sample of the population
and I take the average of their heights. So let's say that value is here. And let's say that the actual
average of the human height is here. So, a 95% confidence
interval is going to tell me an interval where the actual
average is very likely to be. Let me elaborate. Now let me show you an example of
a confidence interval calculation. Let's say we go back to
the island of Statistopia and that there are 6000 adults there. And we want to find the average height
of the people of Statistopia or at least have some interval where
it's very likely that this mean lies. So, since we can't measure all the 6000
adults, you pick 49 of them at random and you found that the mean height of
the sample is 1 meter 70 centimeters. And the population standard
deviation is 25 centimeters. So, let's find a 95%
confidence interval for the average height of
adults on Statistopia. We know that it's probably close to 170,
but let's find an interval for which we're 95% sure that the average of the heights
of the people in Statistopia lies within. Recall that the critical value for a 95% confidence level is 1.96,
as we saw before. So let's start with the margin of error. We know that the formula for
the margin of error is z alpha/2 × the standard deviation
sigma / by the square root n. So that's 1.96 × 25 the standard
deviation / by the root of 49, which is very conveniently 7. So this number is going to be 7. Therefore the confidence interval
is going to be 1 meter 70 or 170 centimeters ± the margin
of error which we know is 7. Therefore, the confidence interval
is between 163 centimeters and 177 centimeters. That is the interval where
we're 95% sure that the average height of the people in Statistopia lives.

In the previous
video, you learned about two-sample t-test, where you wanted to compare two populations
where the two groups being compared were independent. There is another situation where you also have two groups, but they are not independent. Let's say that you want
to test the effectiveness of a training plan
to lose weight. The first group will be the people before the
training program. After four weeks, you weighed
each participant again. These two correspond to
another person, and so on. In this case, you say that
the samples are paired. Now, what you are
interested here is in the difference between pairs. To determine if the
training program was good for weight loss, you can do that by studying the mean difference between
each member of the group. You will have the
weight before minus the weight after the program
for the first person, for the second one, all
the way to the 10th. Since you're interested
in the average behavior, you will sum all these
difference and divide them by the number of samples in
each group, which is 10. It is common to define
a new variable, d, to represent difference
between x and y. You get X_1 minus Y_1 is D_1, X_2 minus Y_2 is D_2, and so on, and so forth all the way to
X_10 minus Y_10 is D_10. This is the number
we're going to study. The sample mean of these variables is going
to be called D-bar. Now, if X and Y were to come
from a Gaussian population, then D is Gaussian as well. Standardizing D-bar, you
get a statistic that has a standard
Gaussian distribution. However, again, the population standard deviation is unknown. Just as you've been
doing the previous test, the best thing to
do is to replace the population
standard deviation by the sample
standard deviation. This is again the t statistic you discovered a
few videos back. It has a t-distribution
with 10 minus one, which is nine
degrees of freedom. That's going to be
your test statistic. Let's figure out what the
observed statistic looks like. You have these 10
weight measurements from the before group, and then these 10 measurements after the training program. If you get the x_i
observations and subtract the y_i
observations one by one, then you get these
differences over here. Those are the difference
in weights from before and after for each one of
the 10 participants. Now with these values for the observations
from the difference, you have an observed
sample mean of 1.09. That's the average
of all the Ds and a sample standard
deviation of 1.485. That gives you an observed
statistic of 2.321. Now, for the first
set of hypotheses, consider the
right-tail test with null hypothesis Mu(D)
equals zero and, alternative hypothesis
Mu(D) is positive. This means that on average, the training program is
good for losing weight. Also, consider a
significance value of 0.05. Now from this last slide, you know that if H_0 is true, then the statistic T= D-bar divided by the
standard deviation of the sample mean has
a t-distribution with 10-1=9 degrees of freedom. But what is the p-value
for the sample? Well, because this is
a right-tail test, the p-value is the
probability under the null hypothesis that the statistic t is greater than the observed statistic 2.321, which corresponds to
this area under the PDF, and that has a value of 0.0227. Since the p-value is smaller than the significance
level of 0.05, then the decision is to reject
the null hypothesis and accept that the population mean for the difference
in weight is positive. That means that the
training program is good for losing weight.

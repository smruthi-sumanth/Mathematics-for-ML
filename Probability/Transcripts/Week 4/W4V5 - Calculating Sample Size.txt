The last example, we had a
population of 6,000 adults. I wanted to calculate
a 95% confidence interval for a sample of 49 adults with a mean height of 170 cm and a standard
deviation of 25, we got a margin of error telling
us that 95% of the time, the population mean was between x-bar + or -7 Centimeters. That gave us a confidence
interval of 163 Centimeters on one end and 177
cm on the other end. But let's say that we're not happy with that 7
cm is too much. We want to have a margin of
error that is much smaller. We want for example 3 Centimeters because
we were going to have a more exact estimate
of the population mean. All of a sudden 49 is too small, so we need a bigger
number of people. We need a bigger sample in order to give
us more confident. The question is, what is the smallest sample
size that will help us obtain the
desired margin of error. We're going to do
similar math as in the previous example,
except backwards. Recall that the formula
for the margin of error is this one over here. Now, we know the value for
everything here except for n. Let's go ahead and substitute the margin of error
into the equation. Now we have that three is equal to set alpha over two times a sigma divided by root n. But since we want a
margin of error of three, that means that getting anything less than
three is even better. If you have a margin of error of two or one, then
that's much better. We can substitute the
equal by a greater than or equal and keep
the right hind the same. Now we get three bigger than or equal than z alpha
over two times Sigma divided by n. Three is a maximum margin of error
that we're allowed to have. Now replacing all the values
we know into our inequality, we get the three is
bigger than 1.96 times 25 divided by root n, from which we can solve
for n and get that n is bigger than or =1.96*25/3^2. That's going to be the
value that we want. What is that value?
That value is 266.78. Since we're talking about people then we can round it to 267, that means that we need a sample of at least
267 adults from the population in order
to get a margin of error of 3 Centimeters. Now let's generalize the formula we just used to calculate the sample size for a particular margin of
error here called MOE. We want the sample to be
at least z Alpha over two, where alpha is the
confidence interval times the standard
deviation Sigma divided by the margin
of error, square. You can plug in any
margin of error into this equation and
get the desired n

So say you compute a sample estimate x bar
and you calculate a confidence interval of 95% and in your interpretation,
you say this the confidence interval contains the true population
parameter 95% of the time. You could be correct. Now, what if you said there
is a 95% probability that the population parameter falls
within the confidence interval? You would be wrong. There's a subtle difference between these
two and we're going to see what it is. So consider the population parameter Mu,
which is a population mean. A defining characteristic of
Mu is that it's fixed but it's unknown is the one
we're trying to estimate. And note that Mu does not have
a probability distribution because it is not random,
it's just unknown. So it's always the same value for
a given population. And because Mu is fixed for
a given interval, it is in the interval or
it is not in the interval. It does not change. So it's not going to fall within a
specified interval 95% of the time or not. The sample mean, on the other hand,
has a probability distribution. The sampling distribution of the sample
means this value changes given the sample taken. So the concept of the confidence
interval is tied to the sample mean and it changes depending on
the value of the sample mean. Saying that you're 95% confident has to
do with repeating the sampling experiment many times and calculating
the intervals for each sample estimate. 95% of the time those confidence
intervals will contain the mean. This confidence level has to do with the
success rate of constructing the confidence interval. It is not the probability that a specific
interval contains the population mean because as we've seen, the population
mean is either on the interval or not. So this is something that is very subtle,
but it needs to be clarified.

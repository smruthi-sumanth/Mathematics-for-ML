In the last lesson, we
looked at how to compute confidence intervals
given a sample mean. We knew we were working with sample means because
we were calculating the confidence interval for the average height
of the population, and recall that when calculating the confidence
interval for sample means, then this is equal
to the sample mean plus or minus the
margin of error, where the margin
of error is given by this formula over here; the z value times the
standard deviation divided by the square root of
the sample size. But now, how do we work with confidence intervals
for proportions? For example, consider
this problem. You want to find out
the proportion of adults who would own a
car in Statistopia. You sample, let's say
30 people so n=30, and out of the 30 people, you'll find that 24
of them own a car. Therefore, x=24. You calculate the proportion
of the people who own a car, and that's given by p hat, and that's 24/30, which is 80%. This is the sample proportion. Now, of course, that may not be the population
proportion, but it's likely to
be close to it, and the question is, how do we calculate a 95% confidence interval
for this sample proportion? Well, similar to the confidence
interval for the mean, the confidence interval
for the proportions is given by the formula p hat, which is your sample proportion plus or minus some
margin of error. Now the question is how to calculate this margin of error? This is where the
difference lies. The margin of error
when calculating the confidence interval for proportions is given
by the formula, margin of error equals the critical value
times the square root of p-hat times one minus p-hat
divided by n. Obviously, the critical value
will depend on the confidence interval you use. The major difference is
in the standard error, and how it's calculated. Just as a sampling
distribution of means, the standard deviation
is given by Sigma divided by square root of n.
The standard deviation of a sampling distribution of proportions is given
by p-hat times one minus p-hat divided by the sample size n. Quick recap. The confidence interval for
proportions is given by p-hat plus or minus
the margin of error, where the margin of error is given by the critical value
times the square root of p-hat times one minus p-hat divided by n. We had an example. We wanted to calculate the
proportion of adults that own a current Statistopia
from the sample size of 30, we found p-hat, the sample
proportion to be 80%, and I want to calculate a
95% confidence interval for the sample proportion. For 95% confidence level, the critical value is 1.96. That's the margin of
error is 1.96 times the square root of
0.8*1-0.8, which is 0.2, divided by the sample size 30, and that gives us a
margin of error of 0.14, and therefore, the 95%
confidence interval is p-hat, which is 0.8 plus or minus the margin of
error, which is 0.14. That means that the confidence
interval is between 0.66 and 0.94, that's 95% confident that the population proportion
of how many people own a car in Statistopia
is within 66% and 94%

Recall this illustration
showing some examples of the confidence interval for sampling distributions
of size 1. Now, you'll be able to construct the confidence interval
for a given sample mean. We need to calculate
the margin error and the width of the intervals for the upper and lower
limits that you'll be adding and subtracting
from the sample mean. The concept of the
confidence interval is heavily tied to the
fact that we're taking multiple samples
off a certain size to get a sampling
distribution of sample means, where with large samples, the sampling distribution
tends towards a Gaussian of the form x bar. If we were to standardize
the distribution, we'd let Mu = 0 and Sigma be 1. We would have to scale this
distribution properly. Now, recall from Week 2 that when a normal
distribution is standardized, then 68% of the population falls one standard deviation
away from the mean, whereas 95% falls two
standard deviations away from the mean. These values over here
are called the z values. Now, focusing only on
95% of the distribution, the actual value
here will be 1.96. Recall the 1-Alpha has
a confidence level, and Alpha/2 here are the
corners of the curve. We call C Alpha/2
the critical value. And thus for a 95%
confidence level, C Alpha/2 is 1.96. This is the first part of the margin of error calculation. Obtain your limits to
define how many of the samples fall within some percentage of
the distribution. Next one is to scale the
distribution to take into account the variability in
the original distribution. We need the standard
deviation of the original
distribution to do that. And so as you already know, this is given by the formula
Sigma over square root n, and it's called a
standard error. Now, multiplying
the standard error with the critical value, you get the margin
of error as you're essentially scaling
the distribution with a standard deviation while using the critical
values to capture the upper and lower limits where 95% of the
distribution will lie. The center of this
distribution is the population mean for the
sampling distributions, and the distribution
looks like this. You then have these margins that indicate an interval where 95% of the time the interval captures
the population mean.

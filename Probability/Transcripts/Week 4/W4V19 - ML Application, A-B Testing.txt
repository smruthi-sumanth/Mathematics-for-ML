Now I'm going to tell
you about A/B testing, which is a really
cool application of two-sample
hypothesis testing. Let's say that as
a data scientist, you are studying a website and this website has a
particular conversion rate. Now let's say you improve
the website and you want to see if the conversion
rate went up or down. For this, you can use A/B
testing. Let me show you how. Suppose your company has
a webpage and it wants to test two different placings
for the buy now button. Let's call each of these
strategies A and B and your goal is to determine switching to Strategy B leads to
higher purchase amounts. To do this, you select
a group of people. As customers come in, they are randomly assigned
to Design A or Design B. The common rule of A/B testing is to send a smaller
proportion of customers to the new design because you don't know
how good it will be. In this case, you've
selected 80 customers for Strategy A and
20 for Strategy B. When you look into the
purchase of each group, you see the Strategy A has
an average purchase of $50 with a sample standard
deviation of $10. While the group
exposed to Strategy B has an average purchase of $55 with a sample standard
deviation of $15. Now that you've designed your experiment and
gathered the data, you can go ahead
and use the test you've already learned
to make a decision. Your null hypothesis would be
that the mean purchase with Option A and the mean for
Option B are the same. While the alternative hypothesis is that the mean purchase for Strategy B is larger than
the one for Strategy A. This hypothesis can
also be written in terms of the
difference of means. You also need to set
a value for Alpha, which in this case
it's going to be 0.05. Now suppose for the sake of
the example that the purchase amounts following
Gaussian distribution. In that case, or if the number of samples is large enough, then you can make your decision using a two-sample t-Test. Notice that if H_0 is true, then according to the t-Test the statistic follows
a t-distribution. Following the formulas
you learned from the independent
two-sample t-Test, the degree of freedom is 23.38, replacing the observed
values in the statistic you get that the observed
statistic is -1.482. What is the p-value
for the sample? Well, in this case you have
a left tailed hypothesis, it's the probability
that a standard normal is smaller than -1.482 and that has
a value of 0.076. What is the value? You won't reject H_0
because the p-value is greater than Alpha = 0.05. What's the difference between
A/B testing and t-Tests? Well, A/B testing is
broader than just t-Tests. It's a methodology for
comparing two variations while the t-Test are statistical
tool A/B testing encompasses many more steps. This includes proposing the
variation to test randomly splitting your sample
subjects and presenting each group with a
different variation, measuring the outcomes and
determining metrics to use. This means, are
you interested in mean behavior and
proportions, dispersion, etc. The very last step in
A/B testing is using statistics tools to make a decision based on
the data gathered. This is where the
t-Test comes in. Also in the previous example, you use the t-Test
because you are comparing means for
Gaussian populations, if that were not the
case, you would use another statistical test
to make the decision. Now imagine that you want
to test a whole new website design for your online
purchase platform. You have the Old Version
A and the New Version B. You're interested
in knowing if B has a higher conversion rate, which is simply
the proportion of visitors that actually
make up purchase. Once again, you need to split your sample randomly
between the two groups. One will be exposed
to Version A on the website and the
other one to Version B. Suppose that you consider
80 customer for Group A and 20 for Group B and 20 customers from Group
A make a purchase while the number
of Group B was 8. The hypothesis would be quite similar as the previous example. For the null hypothesis, you have the both conversion
rates are the same. Well, the alternative
hypothesis you have that the conversion rate and Strategy B is bigger
than Strategy A. If this is the case, then you would like to
deploy the new webpage. Again, let's consider
an Alpha of 0.05. You're interested in
conversion rates, so you're recording a number of customers that make
purchases from each group. These variables actually follow binomial distributions
of parameters in A and P_A for Group A and
B and P_B for Group B. Now what is the
statistic to use in this case? Let's look into it. By the law of large numbers, the X/n_A is similar to
P_A as the number of samples gets big and the same
thing happens for Y/n_B. As you learned the previous week by the central limit theorem, these quotients have a
normal distribution. X/n_A has a mean P_A and
a standard deviation, square root of P_A*1-P_A/n_A. Y and B will have parameters Mu = P_B and Sigma equals
square root of P_B*1-P_B/n_B. That's because this is
the standard deviation for the binomial distribution. These are good approximations
for P_A and P_B. X/n_A- X/n_B will make a good
approximation for P_A-P_B. Since X/n_A and Y/n-B are
approximately Gaussian, then the subtraction
of these two should be Gaussian as well. In this case, Mu will
be the difference P_A-P_B and Sigma will be the square root of the
sum of variances of each. If you're wondering
how we get there, take a look at the reading item. One very common way
to express this is by standardizing
the distribution. Now if H_0 is true, then P_A = P_B, which you can directly
call P. You can replace P_A and P_B by P in
this statistics. Now, let's see if we can rewrite this expression
into something nicer. First, notice that you
have a common term, P*1-P in both terms. Also 1/n_A+1/n_B can be written as n_A+n_B divided by n_A*n_B. You can now replace
it in the statistic, which still has a standard
Gaussian distribution because you perform some
algebraic manipulations. The problem is that while
P_A and P_B are the same, you still don't know the
value of P. You will need to replace it
by an estimation. Since X and Y come from the
same conversion rate P, the best you can do to estimate P is aggregate all
the observations so that X+Y is now
divided by n_A+n_B. Now replacing P*1-P
by P hat*1-P hat, you get the test statistic. After all this math, let's go back to the problem
we're solving. Now to the webpage Designs A and B for the Design A group, you have 80 observations with 20 conversions and for
the Design B group, you had 20 observations with 8 conversions Remember also that X and Y follows
binomial distributions, each with their own
sets of parameters. You are interested
in determining if the conversion rate for
the new design is better. This gives you a
left-tailed test. You also consider significance
level of Alpha = 0.05. As you just saw from
the previous slides, if H_0 is true, then the test statistic follows a Gaussian distribution
with the data you have. This means that the observed
statistic is -2.07. What is the p-value
for the sample? Well, it will be the area under this Gaussian PDF which
has a value of 0.019. Since this is smaller than
the significance level, you can reject the
null hypothesis and accept that as true, that the conversion
rate of Design B is bigger than the
one for Design A.

So ideally you would like to
always make the perfect decisions. Unfortunately, this is impossible to
guarantee due to the randomness of the world and the fact that we only have
partial information from the population under study. So what could go wrong? Well, there are two possible
outcomes to the test. Either you send the email to the spam
box or you send it to the regular inbox. Each of these outcomes could be wrong. In the first case, you send a regular
email, a ham email, to the spam box. This is called a type I error or
a false positive, and it happens when you reject H0
when it was actually true. The other error appears when you
incorrectly determine a spam email to be ham to be a regular email. This is called a type II error or
a false negative and occurs when you don't reject ho and
the hypothesis was actually false. It is important to understand that you
can never know if you are right or wrong about your decision because
you don't know the ground truth. However, you will try our best to
determine a test where you keep these errors below an accepted threshold. This table sums up the possible
outcomes of your decision. If the ground truth is that H0 is true,
that means if the email was actually not spam and you reject H0,
you will be committing a type I error. That means you send a perfectly
good email to the spam box. However, if you decide not to reject H0,
then you would have made the right call. That means you send a good email
to the inbox like you should. If in reality H0 was true,
that means the email was spam, then rejecting H0 will
be the right decision, that means if you get a spam email,
you send it correctly to the spam box. And finally, not rejecting H0
will make a type II error, that means you took a spam email and
sent it to the inbox. Notice that type I and type II errors
don't have the same impact on the problem. In the case of the email assuming that an
email is spam implies that sending a ham email to the spam box
is more positive than sending a spam email to the inbox,
which is true. You would much rather have an accidental
spam email in your inbox than lose a perfectly good email and
never be able to read it because the classifier thought
it was going to be spam. This means that type I errors
are more severe than type II errors. The question is then how much
are you willing to negotiate here? What is the greatest probability of
type I error you're willing to tolerate? Or in other words, on average,
how many times are you willing to incorrectly send a ham email to the spam
box in order to have a good spam detector that still sends most of
the emails to the correct place. Well, the maximum probability of type I
error is called the significance level and is usually denoted by
the Greek letter alpha. Of course, since it's a probability,
it can only take values between 0 and 1. If alpha is 0, it means that whatever evidence you get
the email is always considered to be spam. In that case,
you never get a type I error. On the other end,
if the significance level is 1, that means every email is considered spam,
and in this case, every time you get a ham email,
you will be making a type I error. Of course, most extremes
are terrible decision makers. What you want is something that is
able to define if an email is spam or not, and
has as few type I errors as possible. However, as you saw,
this error can never be made zero, so a typical value to consider is 0.5 for
your significance level. This means that on average, you will decide that a ham
email is spam 5% of the time. Another value usually
encountered is alpha equals 0.1. As we said, you want alpha to be
as small as possible, but however, there's a small catch. If you reduce the probability
of a type I error too much for a fixed number of samples,
then you're increasing the type II error. This is what happens when we thought
of the alpha equal zero scenario. To give the proper definition
of significance level, it is the maximum probability of
committing a type I error, which is the same as the maximum probability of
rejecting H0 when H0 was actually true. The value of alpha is your
design criterion for this test. This means that alpha will determine
a threshold to decide if you should reject H0 or
not based on your sample.

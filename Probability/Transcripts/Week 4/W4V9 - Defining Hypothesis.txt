All right, welcome to lesson two. In this lesson, you're going to
learn about hypothesis testing. Hypothesis testing is a way to
tell if some belief you have of the population is likely to be true or
false. And then we're going to learn a very
important application of hypothesis testing called A/B testing. So first,
let's start with a simple example. So, to understand hypothesis testing,
I like to look at this example. Let's say you have
an email spam detector and what it does is it determines
if a given email is Ham or Spam. And remember that ham is
when an email is not spam. And by default, we're going to
assume that all the emails are ham. And the reason for this is that it's
much worse to delete a good email than to accidentally put
a spam email on our inbox. So our base assumption is going
to be that an email is ham. That's going to be called
the null hypothesis. It's the base assumption when we assume
safely that nothing is happening, This null hypothesis is called H0. And then we have an alternative
hypothesis called H1. And that's the special one,
that's the one we are trying to identify. One important characteristic
of the null and alternative hypothesis is that
they are mutually exclusive. Because the email can't be ham and
spam at the same time. Also, these questions have
to have a true false answer. And the key is to designing
a good set of hypothesis and notice something really important. There's a lot of evidence that
shows that the email is spam. Then the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis that
the email is spam is accepted as true. But this doesn't work
the other way around. If the evidence gathered is not enough
to show that the email is spam, then you can reject the null hypothesis. However, that does not mean
that the email is ham, only that we don't have enough evidence
to show that the email is spam. So in general,
you will need to propose your hypothesis. The null hypothesis is the baseline and the alternative hypothesis
represents the competing statement. And given the asymmetry and
the conclusions, this is usually the one
you're interested in proving. And the goal of hypothesis testing is
deciding between two hypotheses based on data and evidence. In the case of the spam example. Then this evidence comes in the form
of the sender, the attachments, the size of the email,
certain keywords, etc. Anything you can use to show
that the email is spam. Intuitively, when performing
hypothesis testing, if your sample gives plenty
of evidence against H0. Then you will reject
the null hypothesis and consequently accept
the alternative hypothesis. In this case, your evidence based
on data will be different words or phrases in the email. And so, suppose that you get an email
that has phrases like earn extra cash, risk free, dear friend,
act immediately, apply now. And winner these are all trigger
phrases for detecting spam. In fact, these phrases are very likely
to happen if the email is not spam. Which is the null hypothesis under the
hypothesis that this is a regular email. In this case, you would reject H0 and
send the email to spam.

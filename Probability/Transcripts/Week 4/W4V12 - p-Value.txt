So far, the intuition is that if your sample mean falls too far away from the
null hypothesis, then you reject H_0. But what does too far mean? Remember that H_0 is that the population mean
is 66.7 inches. Suppose now that the
variance for the height is three and that there was no
change throughout the years. Remember also that you
had a sample size of 10. In that case, if H_0 is true, then the sample mean, has a Gaussian distribution with parameters Mu=66.7 and
standard deviation 3 divided by square root 10. This is because we have
a sample size of 10. Right now, we're assuming
that the value of standard deviation
Sigma is known. I know that it is not usually
the case, but don't worry, later on you will
learn how to deal with an unknown
standard deviation. Now that you have a
distribution for the statistic, now you can answer the question, how likely was your
sample if H_0, the null hypothesis is true? If your answer is very unlileky, then this is grounds
to reject H_0. Consider now the right-tailed
test for the mean of a population with the
Gaussian distribution. Remember also that the
sample mean was of 68.442, which is bigger than 67. But is this
difference big enough to be statistically significant? Remember that your goal is
to make a decision with a Type 1 error probability of no more than the
significance level Alpha, which in this case, we're
going to pick 0.05. Now, in this case,
a Type 1 error happens when you determine that the population mean
has increased when the true value of
Mu is still 66.7. It makes sense that
if you consider that an observed sample mean of 68.442 is enough to reject H_0, then of course, you would
also reject H_0 if you saw a sample mean
greater than 68.442. What does this mean in terms of the Type 1 error probability? Well, if you reject
H_0 every time you observe a sample mean
greater than 68.442, then the probability of
a Type 1 error is simply the probability that
the sample mean is greater than 68.442, given that Mu is 66.7. The probability you're looking
for is this shaded area, which has a value of 0.0407. Notice that this value
is less than 0.05. With this proposed
rejection criteria, the maximum probability of
incurring a Type 1 error is below the 0.05 threshold you
are willing to tolerate. It then makes sense to
reject the null hypothesis. By the way, the probability
use calculator is called the p-value. What's a p-value? Formerly, the p-value
is a probability, assuming H_0 it's true that
the test statistic takes on a value as extreme as or more extreme than
the value of zero. This means that from
the observed value, you move into the
direction of H_1. In this example, since it
was a right-tailed test, a value as extreme or more extreme than the observed
sample mean meant that you had to consider all the
values greater than 68.442. The p-value measures how well your sample is monitored
under the null hypothesis. A small p-value says
that your sample landed on the tail of the
distribution under H_0, so they're pretty unlikely
to happen if H_0 was true. The p-value is a good metric to create a decision
rule for the test. This decision will ultimately depend on the significance
value you choose. If the p-value is
less than Alpha, you will reject H_0 and
accept H_1 is true. If the p-value is
bigger than Alpha, then you decide if
the evidence is not strong enough and you
don't reject H_0. What do p-values look
for each type of test? For a more general case
called T, the test statistic, you define T observed as the observed value of the
statistics and Mu equals Mu_0, the null hypothesis, where Mu is the parameter
you're looking to test. For right-tailed test, you just saw the p-value
is the probability of the test statistic
being greater than your sample under the
assumption that H_0 is true. For two-tail tests, you want the probability of
all points that are distance from Mu_0 greater than the observed value
in both direction. Finally, for a left-tail test, the p-value is a probability and the test statistic is smaller
than the observed value, always assuming
that H_0 is true. Now let's see what the p-value is for the two-tailed test. Remember that the observed
sample had a 68.442 mean. In this case, the Type 1
error occurs when you accept that Mu is different from
the baseline 66.7 inches. In this case, the p-value is a probability that
the difference in absolute value between the sample mean and 66.7
is greater than 1.742, given that H_0 is true. For this case, we have
to consider both tails since we are considering
the absolute value. This gives us a
probability of 0.082, which is twice as much as what you had for
the right-tail test. In this case, the p-value
is greater than 0.05, so you conclude do
not reject H_0. Finally, consider the
left-tailed test. The original sample
with sample mean 68.442 won't do because it is larger than
the baseline value. Let's imagine the state
that the average mean in your sample was 64.252. In the case of the
left-tailed test, the Type 1 error happens
when you reject that Mu equals 66.7, when
it was actually true. The p-value is the
probability that the sample mean is less
than the observed value, 64.252, which is the
shaded area over here, and it gives a
probability of 0.00094. This is clearly smaller
than Alpha equals 0.005, so you conclude to reject H_0
and accept the hypothesis that the population mean has decreased over the
last 50 years. Notice that this p-value is
not only smaller than 0.05, but it is also
smaller than 0.01, which is another commonly
used significance level. It tells us that even with the more conservative
Alpha of 0.01, you would have rejected
the hypothesis. So far, all the tests we perform using the
statistic H bar, which if H_0 is true, has a Gaussian distribution
with mean Mu_0 and Sigma 3. However, there's an
alternative way to design the test using
the z statistic, which is simply the
standardized version of x-bar. In this case, if H_0 is true, then the z-statistic follows a standard normal distribution. Let's see how this looks
using the right-tailed test. Remember the example
from before? You were looking at
the right-tailed test for the population mean. Let's try to see how
we can formulate the same problem in terms
of the z-statistic. Remember that you had a population standard
deviation of three, a sample size of 10, and an observed sample
mean of 68.442, and the p-value was
the probability of the sample mean
being greater than your observed sample mean under the assumption that
Mu equals 66.7, which had a value of 0.0047. Notice that the hypothesis and the Type 1 error interpretation
need to remain the same. Also, your sample
data doesn't change. Let's see what the z-statistic
looks in this case. The observed statistic is then 68.442-66.7/3 square root
of 10, which is 1.837. How do you transform the
event X bar bigger than 68.442 so that the probability of Type 1 error is stated in
terms of the z-statistic, and its observed value? First, subtract the
population mean under H_0 from both sides, and they scale everything by
3 divided by square root 10. The right-hand side is the
observed statistic, 1.837. Also, since you are now
working with the z-statistic, then you need to
adjust the PDF so that it's the PDF of a
standard normal distribution. Therefore, the 66.7 turns into a zero and the
observed sample mean of 68.442 turns into the observed
z-statistic value, 1.837. Of course, the result of the
p-value has to be the same because you're performing the same test over the same data, and you're just
standardizing the statistic.

So far, all the
hypothesis testing we've done has been with one
sample in one population. But what happens
if we want to take different samples in
different populations? For example, let's say I have
two countries and I believe that the people in
this country are taller than those
in this country, but I can only take samples. Two sample hypothesis
testing is going to tell us how to compare samples
on different populations. In the following videos,
you're going to learn about comparing two populations. Consider for this example that you're interested in
comparing the heights of 18 year olds in the US with the heights of 18
year olds in Argentina. The first group, you have
10 samples x_1 upto x_10, which with the
values shown above, have an observed sample mean of 68.442 inches and a sample
standard deviation of 3.113. For the Argentinian group, you have only nine samples, y_ 1 upto y_9 with
an observed mean of 65.949 inches and a sample standard
deviation of 3.106 inches. Your goal is to determine if the population mean from the US is different than the
population mean from Argentina. Just as with sample tests, you can define three
types of hypothesis. In all three cases,
you will consider the null hypothesis that both population
means are the same. First, you can consider the alternative hypothesis
that the population mean of 18 year olds in the US is bigger than
that in Argentina. You could also consider the
alternative hypothesis that the population mean in the US is smaller than
that in Argentina. Finally, there's an
alternative hypothesis that both population means
are simply different. Writing this hypothesis in
terms of the difference, US minus mu Argentina. You get a right tail test, a left tail test,
and a two tail test. Now let's use the
following assumptions. The first one is
that all people in the sample from the two
groups are different. That means that
there's no one measure that belongs to both groups. The second one is that
each height measurement from each person is independent
from the other ones. The third one is that
the populations for the height in both countries
are normally distributed. This means that
all measurements X coming from the US have a
Gaussian distribution with mean new US and a
standard deviation sigma US and the same goes for the samples
coming from Argentina, which have a mean new Argentina and standard deviation
sigma Argentina. You can then define the
sample means for each group. X bar will be the sample
mean for the US population, and Y bar the one for Argentina. Now the same question is, how does the difference between both sample means distribute? Since it's a linear combination
of Gaussian variables, then it will also be a Gaussian, but with which parameters? The mean will be the difference of the population means and the standard deviation will be the square root of the
variances of each sample mean. If you don't quite
remember the result, you can go back to week 2, lesson 1, where this
result was explained. Of course, you can standardize the difference between X bar and Y bar to get a statistic that has a standard
normal distribution. However, since we don't know the population
standard deviation from any of the two groups, then the best we can do is to replace sigma US and
sigma Argentina with the sample standard
deviation from each group so that you
have the statistics given by x bar minus Y R minus US
minus Argentina divided by the square root of s_x squared over 10 plus
s_y squared over 9. This statistic also has a t distribution
because it corresponds to a statistic for the mean of a Gaussian population
with an unknown Sigma. Unfortunately, the
formula for finding the degrees of freedom
is very cumbersome, but don't worry about it. A bunch of software packages
will do this for you. Replacing n_x, n_y, s_x and x_y by the
observed values, you actually get that
degree of freedom of 16.8 Now after all that math, let's briefly refresh
the problem statement. You have two groups of samples. In this case, we correspond to 10 samples of heights of
18 year olds in the US and the other one to nine
samples of height of 18 year olds from Argentina. From the US sample, you observed a mean of 68.442 inches and a sample standard
deviation of 3.113. While the Argentine sample
has an observed mean of 65.949 inches and a sample
standardiation of 3.106. Let's begin with a
right tailed test with null hypothesis S minus mu Argentina equals zero
and alternative hypothesis that mu US minus mu
Argentina is positive. This means that the
population mean from the US, is greater than the
one from Argentina. Also, let's consider a
significant value of 0.05. From last slide you know
that if H_0 is true, then the statistic T equals
X bar minus Y bar divided by the square root of s_x squared divided by 10 plus s_y
squared divided by 10. Where these are the
sample variances, has a t distribution with
16.8 degrees of freedom. Replacing the observed
values in the statistic, you get that the observed
statistic is 1.7 459. But what's the P value
for this sample? Well, because it's a
right tailed test, the P value is a probability
under the null hypothesis, that the statistic T is greater than the
observed statistic. This corresponds
to this area under the PDF and has a
value of 0.0495. Since the P value
is smaller than the significance level of
0.05 then the decision is to reject the null
hypothesis and to accept the population mean in the US is bigger than the
one in Argentina. Now let's see what you can
say about the two tail tests. All sample values are the same, as is the significance level
and the test statistic. What changes now is how
you calculate the P value. In this case, you want the
probability under H zero that the statistic is in absolute value greater than
the observed statistic, which is the sum of
these two areas, and has a value of 0.0991. In this case, since the P value is greater than
the significance level, you don't have enough
evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the population
means are the same.

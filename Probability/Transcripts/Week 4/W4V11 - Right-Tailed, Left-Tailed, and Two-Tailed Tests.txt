So now that you know
about hypothesis testing, let me show you how to do it for
a population mean. We're going to do both cases again, when you know the standard deviation
of the population, and when you don't. When you don't,
a familiar term will come up again, which is the student t-distribution. Furthermore, we're also going to
learn a very important concept, which is the concept of the p value. In order to get a clear view
of hypothesis testing and how the significant plays its role,
let's analyze another example. Imagine you are interested on the average
height of 18 year olds in the US, and consider a sample of the height
of 10 people measured in inches. If you recall, this is the same dataset
from Week 2 that we used to perform the maximum likelihood estimation for
the mean height. For these observed values,
the average height is 68.442 inches. Before diving into the hypothesis testing, there's one more thing you should
consider, and that is data quality. Since your goal is to make
a decision based on data, then the data needs to be reliable. Otherwise you'll be arriving
to false conclusion. But what does reliable mean? Each sample has to be
representative of the population, the data needs to be
completely randomized. This is to avoid introducing
bias into the decision making. For example, if you're interested in
the height of 18 year olds in the US, and you take all your samples from the
basketball teams of each school, you would be introducing bias in the sample because
in general, basketball players are taller. Also, you should consider the amount
of data you have available. Is the sample size enough
to make a good decision? A good rule of thumb is
considering 30 samples or more. In the examples that follow, we'll be assuming that the samples we
have are good enough for the testing. So historical data says that
the mean height of 18 year olds in the US in the 70s was 66.7 inches. Based on the observed data, can you confirm that the mean height of
18 year olds in the US has increased? So the sample mean you have is 68.442,
which is greater than 66.7. But is this enough to
confirm the hypothesis? Let's try to formulate the null and
alternative hypothesis. Your baseline here is that
nothing has changed and thus that the population mean for
18 year olds is still 66.7 inches. And the competing hypothesis is that
the population mean is greater than 66.7 inches. Note that the hypothesis are always
formulated in terms of the population, in this case the population mean,
and must not involve samples at all. Now, the hypothesis are based on
the population parameters, but the decision will be based on
the observations that you have. In this example, you will base
your decisions on the sample mean, which is the average of
the random samples Xi. If your decision is made
on the sample mean, then the sample mean will
be your test statistic. Note that this is a random variable and
doesn't yet depend on the particular
observations you have. On the other hand, the value 68.442
is called the observed statistic, and it is based on your measurements. In general, a test statistic
will be a function of the random samples that gives information about the
population parameter you want to study. For example, if you are testing
the mean of the population, a good statistic is the sample mean. Same thing goes for
testing probabilities or occurrence rates. If you wanted to test
the variance of the population, then a good candidate is
the s-square statistic. It's important to mention that
the test statistics are not unique. For example, the sum of square
difference between the Xi and the sample mean could also be used
as a test statistic for variance. You will see an example about
this in the following videos. In general,
there are three types of hypothesis. Let's go back to our example. We want to compare the current population
mean with the population mean from the 1970s. There are three sets of questions
that arise under this scenario, each of which can be identified
with a set of hypotheses. The first one was, has the population
height increased in the last 50 years? The baseline here is that the mean
height remained the same, and what you want to prove is that
the population mean actually increases. This means your H0 is that Mu is 66.7, and H1 is that Mu is bigger than 66.7. This one is called a right-tailed test,
because the alternative hypothesis extends to the right
of the null hypothesis, namely because a number bigger than
66.7 is to the right than 66.7. The second question is
whether the population mean decreased during the last 50 years. This leads to the null
hypothesis that Mu is 66.7, and the alternate hypothesis that
Mu has to be less than 66.7. This kind of hypothesis is
called a left-tailed test, because the alternative hypothesis is
to the left of the null hypothesis, namely a number less than 66.7
is to the left than 66.7. And the final question is whether
the mean height has changed at all, either became bigger or became smaller? In this case, the H0 is,
again, that Mu equals 66.7, and H1 is simply that Mu
is different than 66.7. And the null hypothesis is the same. And this is a two-tailed test because
it says that the Mu has changed and has either gone to the right of 66.7,
or to the left of 66.7. So notice that for
these cases the null hypothesis or the baseline is always the same, but the alternative hypothesis changing
depending on what you want to prove. Now let's consider the first
set of hypothesis. This is called a right-tailed hypothesis. Because the alternative hypothesis
to the right of the null, here is H0, the null hypothesis, and
here is the alternative hypothesis. Now, since you're trying to make
a conclusion about the mean of the population, it's natural to consider
your sample mean as a way to get close to the population mean. There is another way you
might see right tail tests, where H0 states that Mu is less than or
equal to 66.7. Both tests are equivalent,
so for simplicity, let's keep the original formulation. If your sample mean is
much greater than 66.7, which is H0, then reject H0 and accept H1. What are the two errors we can have here? Well, type I error will be determining
that Mu is greater than 66.7 when the true value was actually 66.7. A type II error will happen when you
determine that the population mean stayed the same, but the true value was bigger. Now let's look at the second
set of hypothesis. Here H0 is still that
the population mean is 66.7, and your alternative hypothesis is that the
value actually decreased over the years. This is a left-tail hypothesis because the
alternate hypothesis lies to the left of the null hypothesis. And again, you might see
the stats written as follows, H0 says that Mu is greater than or
equal to 66.7, and in this case, if your sample mean is much less
than 66.7, then you would reject H0. In this case a type I error happens when
there was no change in the population mean, but you accepted the hypothesis
that Mu is less than 66.7. While a type II error happens
when you don't reject H0, while there was actually a decrease
in the population mean height. Finally, consider the third
set of hypothesis. This is called a two-tailed test because
the null hypothesis spreads to both sides of the hypothesis. Mu equals 66.7 is that hypothesis. In this case, you will reject H0 when
the sample deviates a lot from 66.7. Since the difference can
be in any direction, a simple way to represents this is
simply taking the absolute value of the difference between the sample mean and
the value in H0, 66.7. In this case, a type I error happens when
there is no change in the population mean but you accepted the hypothesis
that Mu was different from 66.7. While a type II error happens
when you don't reject H0, well, there was actually a variation
in the population mean height.

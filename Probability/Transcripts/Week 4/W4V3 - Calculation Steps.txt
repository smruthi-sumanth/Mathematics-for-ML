Here are the calculation steps for finding the
confidence interval. First you find the sample mean, then you define a desired
confidence level. You next find the critical value for this desired
confidence level, 1 minus Alpha, which is 95%. Then you find the
standard error. This is the standard
deviation of the distribution
of sample means. You multiply the
critical value and the standard error to
get the margin of error. Finally, you add and subtract the margin of
error to a sample mean to obtain the desired confidence interval and there you have it. That's how you calculate
the confidence interval. There are some
assumptions under which computing this confidence
interval works. The first is that the
sample used is random. The second one is that the
sample size is bigger than 30 or the population is
approximately normal, so even though in
our illustrations we use sample sizes
less than 30, when applying the confidence
interval in your work, be sure to follow
these assumptions.

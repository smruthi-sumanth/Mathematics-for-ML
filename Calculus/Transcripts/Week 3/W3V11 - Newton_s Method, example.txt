So now that you know Newton's method,
let's put it in action. I want to recall this function you saw
in Week 2 when you learn about gradient descent. The function was e to the x
minus logarithm of x. And its derivative was
e to the x -1 over x. Recall that the minimum for this function
was the omega constant, 0.5671 etc. And so let's approximate this minimum. Recall that in order to use
Newton's method for a minimum, you actually have to use it to
find the zeros of the derivative. So we're going to try to find
the 0 of this function which is the derivative of e to the x -1 over x. Now what's the derivative
of the derivative? Well, if we take the derivative of
e to the x is again into the x. And the derivative of 1 of x
is minus 1 over x squared. So the derivative of the derivative
is e to the x plus 1 over x squared. That's going to be our f prime of x when
we're taking f of x equals g prime of x. In other words,
our new function to find the 0 is f of x. And we're going to use f prime of
x to help us with Newton's method. So let's start, let's do a few iterations. We start with the iteration,
with the first value x0 equals 0.05. That's the first iteration. Now let's take the derivative and
see where it hits the 0. So it's at a point x1 not too far from it. x1 is given by this formula using
Newton's method we evaluate the derivative at e to
the 0.05 minus 1 over 0.05. That's the derivative divided
by e to the 0.5 plus 1 over 0.05 squared, and we get 0.97. So that's our new point x1. So with x1 we're going to iterate again. We draw the tangent see where it hits and
that's at a point x2. How do we calculate x2? By plugging in these values. So x2 is going to be 0.183. And again we take the derivative, see
where it hits 0 and that's our point x3. How do we calculate x3? Using the derivative again. And the value for x3 is 0.320. We're getting closer,
let's do it one more time. With x3 we draw the derivative. We see where it hits the axis and
we get x4. And to calculate x4 we use the iterative
formula again to get 0.477. Notice how close we're getting
as to one more iteration with x4 we draw the derivative,
we see where it hits. That's at a point x5. And x5 is going to be calculated like
this and the value is going to be 0.558. And let's just do one more. We draw the derivative again,
we see where it hits and it's at x6. And at x6 is going to be 0.567. And notice that with only six iterations, we actually got really close to
the minimum, which is 0.567. Newton's method is actually really,
really fast, and this example shows it. And as you can see, it's just a simple
step that we can iterate many times.

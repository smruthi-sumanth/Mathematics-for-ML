In the previous video, you learned how
the derivative of a derivative can appear naturally in Newton's method. This derivative of a derivative
actually has a name. The second derivative, in this video, I'm
going to show you the second derivative some of its properties and how it can be
really useful in optimization problems. So previously you learn how to use
Newton's method for optimization and remember that this was the iterative
step in order to find the minimum or the maximum of the function. You need to find the zeros
of the derivative, at some point you use this thing,
the derivative of the derivative. So that's new, that's the second
derivative and it's very, very useful. It gives us a lot of
information about the function, Leibniz notation that can be written
as d squared f over dx squared or as d by dx df(x)/dx
Lagrange is much simpler. If f prime is the derivative, then the
second derivative is f prime prime of x. Now, I like to understand
things in real life and remember that to understand the first
derivative, we use velocity because if x is the distance traveled
by a car, then v is velocity. And v is the rate of change of distance
with respect to time or dx/dt. Well, in this case, what's the rate of
change of velocity with respect to time? It's simply the acceleration,
acceleration is dv /dt or d square x over dt squared
acceleration tells us how much the velocity is changing
with respect to time. So if your acceleration is positive means
your velocity is increasing with respect to time. And if the acceleration is negative
means the velocity is decreasing with respect to time. And if you have zero acceleration
means you have constant velocity. So now let's do some plots,
imagine that you're driving your car and this is the plot. So in the horizontal
axis you have time and in the vertical axis you have distance. And let's say that the plot
is this one over here. So let's analyze it bit by bit and let's see how it translates
in terms of velocity. So at the start of your trip, your car
is stopped and you need to start it and increase your velocity until
you reach a constant speed. So the slope keeps getting
bigger as time goes by. Now imagine that this piece of function
can be modeled as 750t squared. And let's say that this behavior
goes on for 2 minutes or 2/60 hours. Now the derivatives for these first
minutes is the line 1500 t, why? Because the derivative of
750 t squared is 1500 t. Now let's say that for the next couple of
minutes you keep going at a steady pace, so you have the same rate of change. Now let's say that this can be modeled
by the equation 50t- 5/6, that's a line. A linear equation. Now, since the distance is linear, then you've reached a constant
velocity of 50 kilometers per hours. Why, because the derivative 50t- 5/6
with respect to t is simply 50. Now, let's say that you keep going for
5 minutes until you realize that you forgot your water home and
you actually need to go back. So at this point you start
pressing the brakes and the brakes make you slow
down until you stop. And when you stop, you have a derivative
of zero and notice that you've reached the maximum because this is as far as you
got after this, you start going back. So you start turning around and
going at a negative speed. And I noticed that the slope starts
positive, but keeps getting smaller and smaller until the richest zero at
the peak value of the distance. And finally it gets negative when you
start going in the opposite direction. So this one over here is the graph
of the speed, you started positive, then you reach zero when you stopped and
then you started going negative because you started going in
the opposite direction as before. Let's say that the expression for the distance was this one minus 1500
t squared plus 300 t minus 11.26. So, what's the equation for the line? Well, is the derivative of this,
which is 300- 3000 t. It's a linear equation. Now, let's say that after
2 minutes of going back, you finally set at a constant speed
until you reach the starting point. So what happens is that over
here you have a constant speed. And let's say the distance
function is 55/6- 50 t. Therefore the velocity is -50. So now that we have the graph of
velocity based on the graph of distance, let's find the graph of acceleration
based on the graph of velocity. So for your first 2 minutes your speed
is aligned that means your derivative is a constant which is a value 1500
because you have a constant acceleration. Then your speed increases
linearly now between two and five minutes when you travel at constant
speed, the acceleration is simply zero. When you're traveling constant
speed you're not accelerating. There's no change in velocity
now between 5 and 7 minutes, your speed is again in line. But now with negative slope because
your deceleration is -3000 or in other words your acceleration is
-3000 because you're decelerating. And finally for the final stretch
you have an acceleration of zero again because you're going
at a constant speed of -50. So when we put the first graph and
the third graph together we go from x to a from distance
all the way to acceleration. And as you can see for the first 2
minutes, when the distance increases at an increasing rate, you have
a positive acceleration between 2 and 5 minutes when you travel at a constant
pace, the acceleration is zero. After six minutes to keep going
forward but slower and slower and between seven minutes you're going back. So for these transitions you
experience a negative acceleration. Notice that at the maximum distance travel
you had a negative acceleration meaning a negative secondary. This is very important. And finally, until the end of your trip, your acceleration become zero since
you're again going at a steady pace. So as you can see, the second derivative
gives a measure of the amount by which a curve deviates from
being a straight line. This is called the curvature. Let me get a bit more into the curvature
when you have a positive second derivative, as in the first piece of the
distance you have a concave up function. This is also a convex function, in this function as you can see
the second derivative is positive and the function is increasing
at an increasing rate. You're increasing the speed and therefore your distance increases more and
more each time. Over here you have the opposite. Your function is concave down and that happens when the second derivative
is negative for the other two, the second derivative is zero for
this, it's inconclusive. So you have no curvature. Now let me get a bit more into curvature. This over here is a concave up function, it looks like a happy face and
this one over here, it's a concave down function,
it looks like a sad face. And the way to tell is when
the second derivative is positive, you have a concave up convex function. And when the second
derivative is negative, you have a concave down function. And how is this useful for optimization? Well, the second derivative tells you
if something is a maximum or a minimum. Remember that the points of derivative
zero are the candidates for maximum or minimum, but
we don't know if their maximum minimum. So the second derivative tells us,
take a look at the first one. This one over here has
a derivative of zero and the second derivative is positive and
it's a local minimum. However, this one over here
is a local maximum and the second derivative is negative. However, for the other two, it's
inconclusive when the second derivative zero, we don't know if we're at
the presence of a maximum or a minimum. Now there's something very
interesting that happens. And is that the first derivative
tells us one thing, and the second derivative tells us another
thing, when the first derivative is positive, we have an increasing function and when it's
negative, we have a decreasing function. However, when the second derivative
is positive, we have concave up and when the secondary is negative,
we have concave down. And as you can see when you
have a concave up point, the point with derivative,
zero is a local minimum. Whereas when you have a concave down, the point where the derivative
is zero is a local maximum.

So in order to really nail down
the concept of a partial derivative, let's do one more example. Let's say that the function now is f(x,
y) = 3x squared times y cubed. So the task is to find the partial
derivative of f with respect to x. So in the following quiz,
calculate the partial derivative of f with respect to x,
or die f over die x. So the way to do this is with the two
previous steps that we learned. Step 1 is treat all the other
variables as constants. So in this case, it's the variable y. That means this y cubed is a constant, so we're going to cover it with a box
to remember that it's a constant. Step 2 says, differentiate the function
using the normal rules of differentiation. So how do we do this? Well, this 3 is a constant, so if you remember the multiplication
by scalar rule, we put this constant here and
that will multiply the derivative. The next factor is x squared. So what's the derivative of
x squared with respect to x? It's simply 2x. And finally,
this gray box is another constant, so it multiplies in the derivative
as the same constant. Now you remember that
the gray box was y cubed. So all of a sudden we have the derivative
is 3 times 2x times y cubed. Simplifying it, its 6xy cubed, and
that's the partial derivative. Now, let's do the other one. What is the partial derivative
of f with respect to y? That's what the next quiz is about. So for this one you do the exact same
thing except now you have to treat the x as a constant because you're taking
the derivative with respect to y. So let's cover x squared with a box
to remember that it's a constant. And now let's take
the derivative just like before. 3 is a constant, so it goes here,
then the constant is a constant, so it goes here, and then the derivative
of y cubed is 3y squared. So now you remember that the constant
was an x squared all along. So the derivative is 3x squared times 3y
squared, which is 9x squared y squared, and that is the partial derivative
of f with respect to y.

So in this video, I'm going to show
you something very interesting. The gradient is pretty useful to minimize
functions of two or more variables in the same way as the derivative was useful
to minimize functions of one variable. So let's go back to
a function of one variable. This , f of x equals x squared. And now let's look at the function
we've been studying in two variables, which is f (x,
y) equals x squared plus y squared. Now ,let's go back to
the function of one variable. When you want to minimize this function,
the minimum point is this point over here. And the way to find it is to find the
point in which the slope is equal to 0. So we take the derivative,
solve that derivative equal 0, and the solution is this
minimum point over here at 0. So what happens with more variables? Well, something very similar. The minimum point is this point over here. And notice that the tangent plane
is actually parallel to the floor, and that's going to happen in
every local minimum and maximum, that the plane is parallel to the floor. Now, since we're not dealing with planes,
but we're done with partial derivatives, let's actually draw the two
partial derivatives. Notice that they are these
two lines over here, and both have slopes of 0 because
they're parallel to the floor. So in other words, the minimum of the
function f on the right happens when both of the slopes of the tangent lines
given by the partial derivatives are 0. And if you have a function of many,
many more variables, say a function of 12 variables, then you're just going to
need for 12 slopes to be 0. Those coresponding to all
the partial derivatives. So now let's do a little bit of math. On the left, you want to solve the slope
equal 0, so the derivative equal 0. That means you want to solve for
f prime of x equals 0. Now, f prime of x for x squared is 2x, because that's
the derivative of x squared. And when you solve for 2x = 0, you're
basically getting the solution x = 0. And x = 0 is precisely
this point over here. Now, what happens when we
do this in more variables? Well, you want the two
partial derivatives to be 0. That means data for dx and dy are both 0. Now, what's df over dx, that's 2x. And df over dy is 2y. So you want 2x = 0 and 2y = 0. That's the same as the point, x, y equals
0, 0, which is this point over here. Now, this time, solving the system
of equations, 2x = 0 and 2y = 0,
was pretty easy to get the point x, y = 0. Sometimes you may have to be
able a little bit of work, but basically, to find the minimums and
maximums, all you have to do is set all the partial derivatives to 0 and
solve that system of equations.

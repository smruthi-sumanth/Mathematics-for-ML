In this video, I'm going to show you a nice way to condense all the partial derivatives into a vector known as the gradient. I'm going to show you what notation is used
for the gradient. Now that you know what a
partial derivative is, you pretty much know
what a gradient is. Recall that if you have a
function in two variables, you can slice it in two ways, treating y as a constant and
treating x as a constant. Each one gives you a different
partial derivatives. The first one gives you the partial derivative
df over dx, which is 2x, and the second one gives you
the partial derivative df over dy, which is 2y. So the gradient is simply the vector containing these
two partial derivatives, so basically the vector 2x, 2y. In general, we call
the vector using the nabla letter nabla f, and that's just
the collection of all the partial derivatives with respect to all the
variables in the function. In this case a vector
of two entries because the function
has two variables. But if the function
has 17 variables, it would simply be a
vector of 17 entries, each one corresponding to
the partial derivative of the function with respect to each one of the variables. These gradient, in
this case 2x, 2y, is a pretty good description of the tangent plane
because it describes the slopes of the two lines
that form that tangent plane. Now let's do a small exercise. Please find the
gradient of f of x, y at the point 2, 3. Feel free to think about it. The answer is nabla f equals 2x, 2y, except for x and y, you replace 2, and 3. This is 2 times 2, and 2 times 3, which is the vector 4, 6. That is the gradient of
the function f of x, y equals x squared plus y
squared at the point 2, 3.

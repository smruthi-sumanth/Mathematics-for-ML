Welcome to Week 2. In Week 1, you learn everything about
functions with one variable. Now you're going to
learn everything about functions with two
or more variables. For example things like a
tangent line in one-dimension will generalize to a tangent
plane in two dimensions. This can also be used in optimization in the
exact same way, and it also applies to machine
learning. In the same way. However, optimizing functions in two or more variables can get very complicated
even for a computer. We're going to introduce methods
that will speed this up. One method that we'll learn
is called gradient descent. Then I will show you how to use gradient descent to
optimize several functions. But for now, let's start with a very important concept,
the tangent plane. In Week 1, you learned
about derivatives of functions in one variable, for example this one, f of x equals x squared, which is a parabola. Visually you can identify
the derivative at each point as the slope of the
tangent line of the point, for example at the
0.2 comma four, the slope of the
tangent is four. The tangent is this
one over here. Now what happens when we have a function of two variables? Well, let's think
of a simple one. Let's think of f of x comma y equals x-squared
plus y-squared. Now the function has two
inputs and one output. Therefore, it needs to be
plot in three-dimensions. We're going to
plot it over here. X and y are the two horizontal
axis and the floor. Z, or f of x, y is plot as the height. Now the tangents are not lines. They're placed like
this plane over here. That is called the
tangent plane. How do we get this
tangent plane? Well, essentially it's
the same as the one DKs, except we have to
take two cases. We have to actually
cut the space into planes and then calculate the
tangents on these planes. Let's say we fix y equals four. That means we're cutting
the space here and we have the red parabola. Now let's cut the space
with x equals two. Now we have another
red parabola. This parabola, we can
find a tangent line. Once we have the two tangent
lines, then we have a plane. Because any two lines that cross actually represent
a unique plane. That one over there
is the tangent plane. What were the
calculations we did here? Well, when we fixed
y equals four, then we cut the space with a slice and we also
let y equals four. That's why this function f of x4 became x squared plus four
squared because y is four. That function is easy to
differentiate with respect to x, the derivative is two x, that's the slope of
one of the lines. When we fixed x
equals two is when we slide the space with
the other direction. Now you get the
function f of 2, y, which is two squared plus y squared by replacing
x equals two. You can differentiate
that with respect to y. You get to y. Now this calculation seems
confusing, don't worry. We're going to elaborate them a little more over the
next few videos.

Now that you've learned
how derivatives work in more than one dimension, I'm going to show you how to
use them in optimization, and the example we're
going to use is the same one we used
before of the sauna, except now the sauna
has two dimensions. In Week 1, you saw a simple example where
you are in a sauna and wanted to get to
the coolest points since you're starting
to feel hot. But in this simple example, you are in the bench
in the sauna and you can only move
in two directions, to the left and to the right. Now let's look at a
more realistic scenario where you can move in any direction because
you're standing anywhere in this room. It's a two-dimensional sauna. Now, let's consider
that the sauna is this five-by-five room
and you're standing here, but you can walk in pretty much any direction
that you want. Again, you're starting to feel
hot so you want to get to the coldest place in the room and the temperature
looks like this. The red points are hot and
the blue points are cold. For each position xy, where x and y are
the two coordinates, the temperature is the value of the function at that point, which is represented
by the height. The red points are high
because they represent hot points and the
blue points are low because they
represent cold points, and the goal is to find
that coldest place, that blue point over
there at the right. First, let's try the
same approach you did on Week 1 to
get to the minimum. Let's say that
you're standing over here and you're going to basically move around
a little bit and see where does it get colder. Let's say you want to take
a step in this direction, and in this direction, and in this direction, and from those you select
which one was colder. Clearly, it's the
blue direction, so let's move one step here. Now let's iterate. Let's continue doing
that and moving in some random steps and
checking out those steps which one took us
to a colder place and continue doing this. It's believable that if
you do this for a while, you will be able
to take steps that take you to the coldest
place in the room. How do you recognize the
coldest place in the room? Well, just like before, it's a place where
if you walk in any direction, you get hotter. There's no way to get colder by taking a step in any direction. Another way to look at it
is if you were to take the tangent plane to the
temperature function, this tangent plane is
parallel to the floor because the two partial
derivatives are both zero, and these are given by dT
over dx and dT over dy, where T is the temperature
function and x and y are the two
coordinates in the sauna. Let's put some numbers here
and see how things go. Let's say that the
temperature is this function 85 minus 1 over 90 times x squared times x minus 6 times y squared
times y minus 6. It's a little more
complicated than the previous one we had of
x squared plus y squared, but the math is very similar. Here is an exercise. Given this function,
try to calculate the partial derivatives
df over dx and df or dy. I encourage you to
pause the video and take pen and paper and
try to calculate them, and I will give you the answers. The answers are df over
dx is minus 1 over 90 times x times 3x minus 12 times y squared times y minus 6. That's the one you obtain by letting y behave
as a constant, and df over dy is minus 1
over 90 times x squared times x minus 6 times
y times 3y minus 12. Those two are the
partial derivatives. Now to find that minimum point, remember that you
have to set them both equal zero and then
solve for x and y. Now this is going to
give us a lot of points, and many of them
won't be the minimum, only one of them will be. We have to go through this slightly tedious
approach of looking at all the pairs xy for which these two partial
derivatives are zero, but that can be done. Take a look at df over dx. It's a product of
several things. For a product of several
things to be zero, one of them at least
has to be zero. The possibilities here
are that x is equal to 0 or that 3x minus
12 is equal to 0, in which case x is equal 4, or that y squared is equal to 0, in which case y is equal to 0, or that y minus 6 is equal to 0, in which case y equal 6. Similarly for df over dy, either x is equal to 0
or x is equal to 6 or y is equal 0 or 3y
minus 12 is equal to 0, in which case y equals 4. Let's put all these
candidates together. For this candidate, if x is equal to 0
or y is equal to 0, then you have one point
where the gradient is zero, and the other points are
all denoted over here. Notice that some points
are outside of the sauna, so we don't care about those. Now, for x equals
0 or y equals 0, those are all maximum
because as you can see, all these points give
85 as the temperature, so those are not the minimum. The only minimum is
this one over here, x equals 4, y equals 4, which is the point
we were looking for. For this point, the
temperature is 73.6, so this is the minimum. As you can see, just like
we did for one variable, you set the derivative
equal to zero, that gives you a
bunch of candidates and then you check
them individually. Over here, we simply said
both derivatives equal to zero and get a lot of candidates and then
check them individually.

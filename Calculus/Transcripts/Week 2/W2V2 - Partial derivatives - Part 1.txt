Before we get to partial derivatives
I wanted to have the following mental picture. Imagine that you have this function of
two variables plotted in 3D space and that you cut it with a plane like this,
what do you get? You get something like this? And in the cut you can see this red
parabola with a tangent over there, that's the partial derivative. Now you can also cut it in another
direction, you can cut it like this and then you get also a red parabola and that
red parabola is a function of one variable. So you can draw tangents like
the black tangent over there. So let me elaborate a little
more if we take our function in the variables X and
Y which is plot in 3D. And let's say we fix a value of Y in
this case its 4, but it can be anything. So we treat y as a constant, all of
a sudden if you treat y as a constant, this is no longer a function of two
variables is now function of only one variable represented by this
red parabola over here. Now let's take some point in that red
parabola and let's draw a tangent like it's drawn here, that black line,
what is the slope of this line? The slope of this line is
the partial derivative. So how do we calculate
a partial derivative? Well, it's very simple, let's take
the formula for the function f (x, y) equals x squared plus y squared,
since we fixedy and it doesn't really matter
what value we fixed it too. We are treating y as a constant. So when you differentiate this function
now this function is only a function of x. So when you take the derivative with
respect to x which we're going to call di fover di ym where di is this symbol
over here, that's partial derivative. Then it's going to be 2x which
is the derivative of x squared with respect to x plus zero because
0 is the derivative of a constant. Remember that y squared is now a constant
so its derivative with respect to x is 0. So therefore the slope of
this line over here is 2x, so you can take two partial derivatives
with respect to x and with respect to y. So what happens when we
treat y as a constant? Well, the partial derivative is 2x and
if we were to treat x as a constant, then the partial derivative is 2y because
the derivative of x squared 0 and the derivative and y squared is 2y. In other words,
if you have a function f(x, y) you can take two partial derivatives. There's two ways to denote it,
one is f sub x and the other one is di f over die x. And you can also take the partial
derivative respect to y and that's fy or di f over di y. So these two are the two partial
derivatives you can take of this function and as you can imagine if I have
a function not of two variables, but let's say 10 variables,
then I can take 10 partial derivatives, one with respect to each of the variables. Now those calculations weren't super
clear, let me do them in detail here. So let's say you have the function f of
(x, y) equals x squared plus y squared. And the task is to find the partial
derivative of x with respect to x and y. So let's do di f over di x first,
we're going to try to find this two and as I said before, that's the partial
derivative notation over here. So when you want to find the partial
derivative of f with respect to x, there are two steps. The first step is to treat all the
variables as constants, so in this case, y is the other variable so
we're going to treat y as a constant. And step two says differentiate
the function using the normal rules of differentiation. So let's start,
this y squared over here is a constant. So it might as well be a 1,
we can think of this as f(x, y) equals x squared plus 1 because the derivative
of 1 is 0 because it's a constant. So di f over di x is
simply 2x because that's the derivative of x squared and
what's di f over di y? Well, now x is the one that
behaves as a constant. So we can think of this as 1 plus
y squared, or 7 plus y squared, or anything you want. And the derivative of 1 plus y
squared with respect to y, is 2y. So those are the partial derivatives.

Now that you know
what a derivative is, let me show you a very
interesting property of it. Let's go back to the table. But just as this
little piece between 19 seconds and 20 seconds, notice that the
distance at 19 is 265 and the distance
of 20 is 265. The distance is the
same at both points. It hits that perhaps the car didn't move
in that interval. Maybe it moved and
then came back, but let's assume that
it didn't move at all. This is how the interval
between 19 and 20 looks. The line between these points is a horizontal line and a horizontal line
has a slope of zero. Here's the calculation. The slope is the change in
x over the change in t. The change in x is the distance at 20
minus distance at 19. That is 265 minus 265. Now the change in t is 1 second. The slope is 0/1 because
there is no rise in distance. Distance doesn't change. Therefore the slope is
zero meters per second. Now let's look at a
trajectory of the car. We're going to plot
it on the right. First the cargo forward, then it stops, then
it goes backwards, and then it stops,
goes forward again, and then backwards again
and then forwards again. Here is a quiz question for you. Given this trajectory, where was the velocity
of the car zero? If you said that at
any of the points where the tangent is horizontal, therefore, the
tangent has Slope 0. You were correct. Those are the points where the
car was stopped. In total, they are five points. Now let me ask you
another quiz question. At what time was the car farthest from its
starting point? The answer is over here, because this is when
the distance was 50 and that's the
highest distance that you can find in this graph. Now notice something
interesting. The point where the distance
was the farthest is coincidentally one of the points where the car was stopped. This is no coincidence
because if the car is moving, then it could just go further. The point where the
car is the farthest is a point where the
car is not moving. That means if you want to find the maximum or the
minimum in a function, it occurs at one of the points where the derivative is zero. Or in other words, where the
tangent line is horizontal.

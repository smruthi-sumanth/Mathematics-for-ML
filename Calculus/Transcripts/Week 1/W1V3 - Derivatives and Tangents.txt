In the previous video, you
learned how to calculate the average velocity
of an interval, but what is the instantaneous
velocity at a point? Let's look at the point t equals 12.5 that you were
looking at before. Calculating the instantaneous
velocity here may be hard, but estimating it is possible. For example, let's take another
point to the right of t equals 12.5 and calculate the average velocity
over that interval. That is the slope of
this line over here, which is exactly Delta x, the change in distance
divided by Delta t, the change in time. But that is not
the instantaneous velocity at t equals 12.5. However, you can
get closer to it by making this interval
smaller, for example, take now this point over here
closer to t equals 12.5 and the average velocity
of that interval is the new Delta x over
the new Delta t, which is a slope
of these new line. Now let's put the
point even closer to 12.5 and even closer. Now imagine putting it so close that you can't even tell the distance
between the two. You get the limit which
is dx over dt and that is precisely the tangent line to
the curve at t equals 12.5. This measure of how
fast the distance is changing with respect
to time is called the instantaneous rate
of change and it is the slope of that tangent line. More generally, the
instantaneous rate of change is a measure of how fast the relation between two variables is
changing at any point. In other words, imagine that
you move a tiny distance, dx in a tiny
interval of time dt. This is the instantaneous
rate of change. It's also called the derivative. The derivative of a
function at a point is precisely the slope of the tangent at that
particular point.

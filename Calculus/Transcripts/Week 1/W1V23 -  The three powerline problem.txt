So now the problem gets harder because
there are three power lines and the third one is at
a distance c from the origin. So again, the problem is where to
locate the house to minimize the cost. So recall that the distances to
the power lines are x- a for the first house, b- x for the second
house and c- x for the third house. And again,
we don't have to worry if it's x- b or b- x in the houses to the right
to the left of power line. Because when we square these numbers,
we always get positive numbers. If it's b- x or x- b,
it's still going to be x- b square. So let's actually draw these as areas. So, this is x- a squared area
of this square over here. That's the cost of connecting
to the first power line. This one is the cost of connecting to
the second power line, x- b squared. And this one is the cost of
connecting to the third power line, it's much more expensive because it's
much farther than the x- c squared. And again, the goal is to minimize the
cost of connecting to the power lines and that's the same as minimizing the area. So I wanted to take a wild guess and
tell me, what do you think is the cost
function of this whole problem? That's in the next quiz. If you said it's (x- a) squared +
(x + b) squared + (x- c) squared, then you are right because
that is the cost function and that's the total area
of the three squares. So the question is where should we
put the house to minimize the cost? So now I'd like you to take a guess. What do you think is the solution? What do you think is the optimal
x that will minimize this cost? And so if you said that
the solution is a + b + c over 3. So put the house in the average of
the three coordinates of the power lines, then you were right. And now let me tell you why. So I like to see this
geometrically in the following way, let's put a parabola
over the blue power line. And what does this problem mean? Well this is exactly
the function x- a squared. If you look at where the house is
the height in that parabola is the price of connecting to that power line because
it's precisely the parabola x- a squared. Here we put the parabola x - b squared
on top of the orange power line and x- c squared on top of
the green power line and the some of the streets
is parabola over here. If you summed the heights of the three
parabolas, you get the black parabola. And the point is to find that
minimum point in the black parabola, the point where the slope
of the tangent is zero. And as you can see it hints to be
the average of the three coordinates. But let's do some math just like before
in order to solve for that perfect x. And again it's going to be the point
where the slope of the tangent is zero. So just some similar math time before, now we take the derivative of
the cost function set equal to zero. The derivative is this and
we can divide by 2 and still get 0. And we organize this as 3x- a- b- c = 0. So 3x is equal to a + b+ c. And therefore X is equal to
the average of a, b and c. And so if you look at it
from the area perspective, what you're trying to do is minimize
the total area of the squares. If you put your house way to the left,
you have some big areas. If you put your house somewhere in
the middle, you get some small areas and if you put it to the right,
you get again some big areas. Now, this can be generalized. You can imagine that if you were to
have n power lines, for example, in coordinates a1, a2 up to an. Then the solution would be to
put the house in the average of the coordinates of all the power lines. And this is actually the square
loss of very important loss function in machine learning. And that's going to pop out
again later in this course.

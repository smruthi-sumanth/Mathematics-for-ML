Let's take a look
at another family of functions, the
trigonometric ones. Let's start with
the sine function. Let's consider a few
particular points. Minus Pi over 2, Pi over 2, 0, and minus Pi. Let's look at the
slopes at this point. The slope at Pi over 2 is 0, the slope at minus
Pi over 2 is 0, the slope at 0 is actually 1, and the slope at minus Pi, it's going to be minus 1, that's the one on the left. Now let's compare it with
the function cosine. Now we're not going to
look at the slopes, we're actually going
to look at the values. At Pi over 2, the value of cos is 0, at minus Pi over 2 is 0. At 0 it's 1 and at
minus Pi it's minus 1. Do you think that's a
coincidence? Actually, it's not. It's always the case that
if f of x is sine of x, then the derivative f prime
of x is the cosine of x. Why would this happen? We'll take a look
at it in a minute, but it's a really,
really nice property. Now, the same thing happens
in the opposite way, except with the minus sign. If this is cosine, let's take a look
at some slopes. At 0 minus Pi, Pi over 2 and minus Pi over 2. At 0, the slope is 0, at minus Pi the
slope is 0 again. At Pi over 2 it's minus 1, and at minus Pi over 2 it is 1 Now let's look at sine of x, but the values now. At 0 you get 0, at minus Pi you get 0. At Pi over 2 you get 1 and at minus Pi over 2
you get a minus 1. It's almost the
same, we just have to flip it with a sign. If f of x is cos x, then derivative is
negative sine of x. Again, we'll see
why in a minute, but this is something
to remember. The derivative of
sine is cosine and the derivative of cosine
is negative sine. There's a nice geometric
reason why this works and take a look. Let's take a circle of
radius 1 and let's draw any radial line
and x is the angle between the horizontal
axis and the line. The projection
over the x-axis is cosine effects and
the projection over the y-axis is sine of x. Now let's move the
angle x slightly by a quantity of Delta x. Now the projection on the
horizontal axis is going to be cosine of x plus Delta x, and the projection over the vertical axis is going to
be sine of x plus Delta x. Now let's focus on
this orange triangle over here and let's actually
blow it up a little bit. This triangle has
one base equal to negative Delta cosine of x, and the other side
is Delta sine of x. Now we can call the
top angle Phi and the hypotenuse h. If you
recall from trigonometry, there is a rule that states
that given a right triangle, the cosine of one of
the angles is equal to the adjacent side divided
by the hypotenuse. The adjacent side
here is Delta sine x, while the hypotenuse
is h. Now given that Delta sine x equals h cos Phi. Similarly, there's
a rule that states that the sine is equal to the opposite
divided by the hypotenuse. In this triangle,
the opposite side is negative Delta cos x, while the hypotenuse is again h. Therefore negative Delta
cos h is h sine of Theta. Now what happens as delta
gets smaller and smaller? Well, the hypotenuse of
this triangle almost coincides with the
arch of the circle and approaches Delta of x. The angle Phi approaches x
and with this new values, we get that Delta sine
x equals Delta x cos x, and negative cos x
equals Delta x sine x. Also Delta sine x divided by Delta x goes to the
derivative of sine x, and Delta cos x divided by Delta x is the
derivative of cosine of x. This actually confirms the
intuition you built before. Sine prime of x is cos x and cos prime of x
is negative sine x.

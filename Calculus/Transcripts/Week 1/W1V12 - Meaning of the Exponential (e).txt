Let's set our eyes in a very important function,
the exponential function. For this, we need to
define Euler's number. Euler's number is quite a
special number of mathematics. It appears in many branches and it can be defined
in many ways. One of them is by the numerical
value 2.71828182, etc. The decimal never terminates because a number is irrational, which means it
cannot be expressed as a ratio between two integers. Another way to define it is using the expression
1 plus 1 over n to the n. Let's look at this expression for several
values of n. For 1, it's 1 plus 1 over 1 to
the one which is two. For 10 is 1 plus a tenth
to the 10, which is 2.594. For 100 is 2.705. For 1,000 is 2.717. As you notice, the
more we increase n, the more these converges
to a certain number. The actual number that this
gets closer and closer is e, 2.71828182, etc. That's how we're going to define the number e and e has a
very particular property. If you consider the function
f of x equals e to the x, that function is
its own derivative. The derivative of f
of x is also f of x. That particular property
makes sure that e appears in many places in science,
statistics, probability, etc. Now, the way I like to define
e is using interest rates. Let's look at the
following problem. Let's say that you're
trying to find the best bank where
to put your money. Bank 1 says the following. Bank 1 says, I'm not going to give you any money for a year. But after a year, I will give you as interest,
100 percent of your money. That means all your
money once a year. Means if you put in
$5 today in a year, they give you another $5. That's pretty good, but
you continue looking. Let's go to bank number 2. Bank number 2 says, well, I'm going to give you 50 percent of your money every six months. If you put in $10
today, in six months, you're going to have $15 because bank 2 gives you half of
your money twice a year. Bank 3 is slightly different. This one says, I'm
going to give you 1/3 of your money
three times a year, so 33 percent every four months. In summary, bank 1 gives you
all your money once a year, bank 2 gives you half
for money twice a year, and bank 3 gives you a third of your money three times a year. The question is,
which bank is better? Let's take five seconds
for you to figure out. If you need more
time, feel free to pause the video and
think about it. This is a very
important problem. The answer is that bank 3 is
the best bank of the three. Why? Well, let's
say you have $1. So bank 1 after a year
gives you another one, so you end up with $2. Now, the question is, what are you going to
end up with in bank 2 and what are you going
to end up with in bank 3? In other words, what's the
percentage that you end up getting in a year in
bank 2 and bank 3. Let's take a look. Bank 1, you have $1 now. In a year, you're going
to have your dollar plus the extra dollar that bank 1 gives you of
interests, that's $2. We can express the two
as 1 plus 1 to the 1. That's going to be
important later. In bank 2, now, you have
$1 and in six months, you have $1 plus a half. In one year, you're going to have $8
plus a half of that. In six months, you end up with
1 plus 1/2, which is 1.5. In one year, you
end up with 2.25, which is 1 plus 1/2 squared is because you're adding
half of your money, which means you're
multiplying it by 1 plus 1 half every time and 2.25 is bigger than two because
your dollar got doubled. But this amount
of money that you earned actually earned
more money later. This is called accrued
interests into money that gains interests and then that
interests gains interests. That's why you did better
with bank 2 than with bank 1. Now, let's take a
look at bank 3. In bank 3, you start
with $1 right now. In four months, you have $1
plus 1/3, which is 1.33. In eight months,
you have your 1 and 1/3 plus a 1/3 of that. That's 1.77. In one year you have 1.77 plus 1/3 of
that, which is 2.37. Again, you did well
because this interest over here accrued interests
and accrued more interest. This interest over here
accrued more interests. Your money is making more money. At the beginning of
the year, you had $1, then you have 1 plus 1/3, then you had 1 plus 1/3 squared, and then you had
1 plus 1/3 cube, and that becomes 237. In short, in bank 1 after
one year, you have $2. In bank 2 after one
year, you have 2.25. In bank 3 after one
year, you have 2.37. That's why the money
is better in bank 3. This money actually
multiplies a lot. Take a look at what happens
in bank 1 after four years, you're going to end up with $16. In bank 2 after four years, you're going to end
up with more money. You're going to end
up with $25.63. In bank 3, you're going to end up with quite a lot of money. You're going to end
up with $31.57. Definitely bank 3 is much
better than bank 1 and bank 2. Again, let's recall
that after one year, in bank 1 you get
1 plus 1 to the 1, bank 2, you get 1 plus 1/2 to 2 and in bank 3 get 1
plus 1/3 to the 3. This is super important. Now, could you imagine a
better bank than these three? Well, of course, the more subdivisions
you have, the better. Let's look at bank 12. Bank 12 gives you 1/12 of
your money every month. You start with $1
now, in a month, you have 1 plus
1/12, in two months, 1 plus 1/12 squared and
so on until in 12 months, you have 1 plus 1/12 to
the 12th and that's $2.61. You did much better. In general, bank n, would have
n subdivisions. It subdivides the year into
n intervals and every time, it gives you one
nth of your money. You start with one
on the first day. After first interval, 1 plus 1 over n. After the
second interval, 1 plus 1 over n squared. If this is not super
clear, let me elaborate. 1 plus 1 over n is the money you have and you add an nth of that. You have 1 plus 1
over n plus 1 over n, 1 plus 1 over n and that is the money you have plus
the interests you accrue. That factors is 1
plus 1 over n square. After three intervals, you
have 1 plus 1 over n cubed. After k intervals, you have 1 plus 1 over
n to the k. Eventually, after the end of the year, you have 1 plus 1 over n to
the n. N can be really large, so you could potentially accrue money every second or
every millisecond. In summary, bank n
does the following, it gives you 1 plus 1 over n to the n at
the end of the year because it returns one nth of your money and times a year. Now imagine that you go
around looking for banks. There's bank 1, there's
bank 2, there's 3. Bank 4 gives you a quarter of your money
four times a year. Bank 5 gives you a fifth
of your money five times a year and so on until
the end of the universe. Here's bank 12 that gives you 1/12 of your money every month. Here's bank 365, that gives you 1/365 of your money every day. What's at the very
end of the years? What is this bank? Well, this bank, let's call
it bank infinity. What bank infinity does is it pretty much gives
you instant interests. One infinity of your money
infinity times a year. Let's see how much
money bank infinity would give you at
the end of the year. Bank 1 ends up with
1 plus 1 to the 1. Bank 2 with 1 plus 1/2 to the 2. Bank 3 is 1 plus 1/3 to the 3 and 12 is 1 plus
1/12 to the 12. Bank 365 is 1 plus
1/365 to the 365, which already is 2.7145. Bank infinity gives you, well, this is not a good
mathematical expression, 1 plus 1 over infinity
to the infinity. But it's basically the number that all these numbers
converge to 2.25, 2.37, 2.613, 2.7145, etc. Gets closer and closer
to a particular number. That number is 2.7182812
or the number e. So e is the amount of money that you get at the end of the
year in bank infinity because bank infinity gives you an infinitesimal if your
money every single instant. That is one way to
look at the number e.

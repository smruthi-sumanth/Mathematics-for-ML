So now let's say you have two power lines,
a blue one and an orange one. And for reference, here is the origin. So the blue power line is
a meters away from the origin. The orange power line is b
meters away from the origin, and your house is x meters
away from the origin. And the point is to find out
where to locate the house, to minimize the cost of connecting
to the two power lines. So, the distance from the house to
the blue power line is x minus a. And the distance from the house
to the orange power line is going to be b minus x. So, the cost of connecting to
the blue power line is going to be the distance squared,
that's x minus a square. And the cost of connecting to the orange
power line is going to be that distante square, which is b minus x squared. Now, notice that b minus x squared
is the same as x minus b squared, because the square of a negative number
is the square of the positive number two. So therefore we're going to consider
this distance as x minus a, x minus b, x minus c, etc. And even if they're negative, that doesn't matter because
the squares are the right thing. So now, what is the total cost of
connecting to both power lines? Well, is the sum of these two costs,
x minus a squared, plus x minus b squared. And if x is over here, then the point of
the problem is to find the distance x, that will minimize this cost function. So spoiler alert, the solution is to put
it in the very middle of the two power lines to reduce the cost, and
you're going to see that very soon. But first, let's try to visualize the
problem to better understand why the house should go in the middle. So, let's actually visualize
the cost as the area of a square, because the area of the square
is x minus a squared. That's the cost of connecting
to the blue power line. And the cost of connecting to
the orange power line is represented by the area of this squared over here,
which is x minus b square. And the sum of the two areas, or the total area is the total cost
of connecting to both power lines. That is the function that we
are supposed to minimize. So now let's look at some cases,
see if the house is somewhere here, the sum of the areas is not that big. If we put it too much to the left,
then the orange square is too big. And if we put it too much to the right,
then the blue square is too big. So it makes sense that somewhere in
the middle should be the perfect spot. But let's use mathematics
to find the perfect spot. So, the cost function is x minus
a squared, plus x minus b squared. This is a quadratic and
quadratics look like this, either they point upwards or
they point downwards. This one in particular points upwards, because the coefficient
of x squared is positive. In other words, it's two x squared,
plus something else, plus something else. Now, in this parabola,
we have to find the minimum point. Which is the point where
the derivative is zero, the point where the slope
of the tangent is zero. So this tangent is horizontal, and
we can find that using some calculations. So let's take the derivative
of the cost function. That's d by dx of x minus a squared
plus x minus b squared, and set that equal to zero. Because when that is equal to zero,
that is the minimum point. So, by using the chain rule, you can see that the derivative of x
minus a squared is 2 times x minus a. And the derivative of x minus b
squared is 2 times x minus b, and so that sum is equal to zero. You can divide by two to get x minus a,
plus x minus b equals zero. And now reorganize to get 2x
minus a minus b equals zero, and that's equivalent to x equal a plus b. So, x is equal to a plus b over 2. So the optimal solution is
to put the house in the very middle of the two power lines
in order to minimize the cost. So now, let's do it with more power lines.

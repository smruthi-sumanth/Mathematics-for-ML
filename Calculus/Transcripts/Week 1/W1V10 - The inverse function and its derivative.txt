Now you learned the derivative of several functions here's an important concept
that's going to help you find the derivative
of more functions. It's the concept of
the inverse function. Now, what is an
inverse function? Well, if your function
does a certain thing, then the inverse
function is the one that undoes that thing. So for example, if
the function f, sends the number 3
to the number 5, then the inverse function
sends the number 5 back to the number 3. Now you're going to learn that if you know the
derivative of function f, then the derivative of the
inverse function is actually very easy to calculate because they are
very well connected. The mental image I have of an inverse function
is the following. Let's say that you
have a person and the function f does
something to the person. It puts a hat on them. What would the function g have
to do if it's the inverse? Well, it would just
remove the hat so that you get the
original person back. In other words, the inverse does the opposite
of what f does. It undoes what f does. In a more mathematical example, let's say you have
the variable x and f puts on a hat on
it, so it squares it. Let's see. What
would g have to do? Well, undo the square, so remove the hat, g is a function
that takes as input x squared and returns x. Before we get to see
what f and g are, let's take a look
at some notation, g of x and f of x are inverses. We write this as g of x equals f inverse of x with an
exponent of minus 1. But this is not 1 over f of x. This is purely notation. If you take x and apply
f and then apply g, you get back the x
you started with. Basically, g undoes what f does. What are f and g on the
example on the left? Well, f is easy, it's simply x squared and g is the function
that undoes the square, so it's basically
square root of x. The reason is that if you take x and square it and then
take the square root, you get back x. This is only for x
positive numbers and also we're only taking the positive square
root, not the negative. But in short, if
f does something, g has to undo it to get
your first input back. Now the derivatives of
inverses are really nice. Let's take a look at the
plot of x squared and now the plot of g of y
equals square root of y. Notice that in this plot the units are different in
the left and the right. Also in the plotting the left, the horizontal axis is x, and in the plotting the right,
the horizontal axis is y. But in short, if a point
with coordinates a,b appears on the left
then the point with coordinates b,a
appears on the right. So for example, on the left, we have the point 1/2,1/4, on the right we have
the point 1/4,1/2. This is because 1/4
is the square of 1/2 and 1/2 is the
square root of 1/4. The point basically f
one-half is equal to one-quarter and g of
1/4 is equal to 1/2. The point 1,1 also
appears on both because f of 1 is 1
as 1 squared is 1, and g of 1 is 1 because
the square root of 1 is 1. The point 3/2, 9/4 also appears on the left, and the point 9/4, 3/2
appears on the right. Similarly, point square root of 3,3 appears on the
left and the point 3, square root of 3
appears on the right. Now I want you to take
a careful look at the tangents of these points in the left plot and in the right plot and let's
question yourself. Do you think there's
a connection between the slopes
of the tangent on the left and the slopes of
the tangents of the right? Well, consider that the
plot on the right is the reflection of the plot on the left over the
diagonal y equals x. There's going to be a
really nice connection between these slopes. Let's take, for
example, a secant. Before we draw a tangent,
let's draw a secant. Let's take the point
1,1 which is in both plots and let's
take the point 1.5, 2.25 on the left because
2.25 is the square of 1.5, and the point 2.25, 1.5 on the right. Let's calculate the slope
of this secant line. On the left, it's Delta
f divided by Delta x. The change in the
vertical coordinate divided by the change in
the horizontal coordinate. On the right, this is going
to be Delta g over Delta y, where Delta g is the change in the vertical coordinate and Delta y is the change in
the horizontal coordinate. However, these plots are a
reflection of the other. Therefore, any horizontal
distance on the left is equal to the vertical distance on the right and vice versa. In other words, this Delta g
is the same as this Delta x and this Delta y is the same
as this Delta f. Therefore, the slope Delta g over
Delta y is the same as Delta x over Delta f. Now, notice that as
Delta x goes to 0, f prime of x is Delta
f over Delta x. Equally as Delta y goes to 0, then g prime of y is
Delta g over Delta y. Putting this together, we get that g prime of y is
1 over f prime of x. This looks complicated,
but it only says that if f and g are
inverse functions, then the derivative of g is
1 over the derivative of f. Let's look at a simple example. This time we have two plots of x squared and
square root of y, where the actual units are going to be the
same on the left, and on the right; each
square is one by one. Let's look at the tangents. At the point 1,1 we have that f of 1 is 1
and g of 1 is 1. The point 1,1 appears
on both plots. Now, take a look at the
tangent on the left. Since f prime of x is 2x because it's the
derivative of x squared, then f prime of 1 is 2, which means that this orange
line has a slope of 2. Now let's take a look at
the slope on the right, the tangent g prime of y
is what we want to find. We want to find the
slope of that tangent. Well, since g prime of 1
is 1 over f prime of 1, then this is 1/2,
which is a half. Therefore, a half is the slope of the
tangent on the right. It makes sense, right? If the slope of the
tangent on the left, the orange one is 2, then the slope of the
tangent on the right is 1/2 the reciprocal of 2. Now let's do another
example, the point 2,4. On the left, we have the
point 2,4 and on the right, we have the point
4,2 because f of 2 is 4 and g of 4 is 2. Now, the slope on
the left, well, since the derivative
f prime of x is 2x, then f prime of 2 is 4, which is 2 times 2. What do you think this
slope is going to be? It's probably going to
be 1/4 because it's 1 divided by the
slope on the left. And indeed it is, because g prime of 4
is 1 over f prime of 2, and that's 1/4. In other words, if f and
g are inverse functions, then the derivative of g is
1 over the derivative of x.

Like any language, mathematics has
its way of expressing concepts. In this video, I'm going to show you
two ways to express the derivative. The first one is Leibniz's notation and
the second one is Lagrange's notation. Let me show you how they work. So first recall that the slope was
calculated as the change in distance over the change in time,
that's delta x over delta t. And that the slope of a tangent
at a point was called dx over dt. Now, what was this dx and this dt? Well, in order to calculate the slope,
you first started with a big interval calculated delta x over delta t,
that's the slope of that secant. And then made the interval smaller and
smaller, always calculating delta x over delta t. Until the interval was so
tiny that you get the tangent line, and this slope was called dx over dt. Now dx over dt represent infinitesimal
changes in the x direction and in the t direction. So that's one way of writing
the derivative as dx over dt. Now in general we're going to
have X as the horizontal axis and Y as the vertical axis. So the derivative is going to
be called dy over dx instead. So here's some notation, let's say
that your function is called f(x), and that's y, so y is f(x). Now the derivative of f can be
expressed in two ways, one is as f'(x). So recall the function is f and at the
point x the slope of the line is f'(x), that is like Lagrange's notation. And the other one is the one you just saw,
which is dy over dx, that can also be expressed
as d over dx of f(x). In this case d over dx can be
thought of as an operator, something that when you apply
to f(x) you get something else, and this is Leibniz's notation. So sometimes in this course we're going to
use Lagrange's notation, f'(x), and other times we're going to use dy over dx,
which is Leibniz's notation. And we're normally just going to
pick the one that's more convenient.

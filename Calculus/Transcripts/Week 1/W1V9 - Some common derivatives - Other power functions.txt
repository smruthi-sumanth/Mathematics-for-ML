Now that you know lines
and some polynomials, let's look at a
complicated one, 1/x. This is a hyperbola
that looks like this. Let's take a look at some
of the tangent lines. The function looks
more complicated, but actually the
calculation is quite simple for the
calculation when we do x plus Delta x inverse
minus x inverse divided by Delta x. Let's look at the point x
equals 1 and y equals 1. Let's take some interval
just like before. If the interval is of
length 1 horizontally, Delta x equals 1, then what is Delta f? Well, Delta f is going to be the change in the
vertical direction, so x plus Delta x inverse minus
x inverse for x equals 1. That means it's 1/2 minus 1. That's minus 0.5. The slope is minus
0.5 divided by 1, which means that the
slope here is minus 0.5. Now let's decrease the
length of the interval. Let's make it so
that Delta x is 1/2. If Delta x is 1/2, then what's delta f? Well, is 1 plus 1/2
inverse minus 1 inverse, which is 2/3 minus 1, which is minus 1/3. Delta x is simply
going to be 1/2. The slope is 0.33 divide by 0.5, which is minus
0.67 or minus 2/3. Now let's do some
more and again, I'll go a little faster
to the calculations. For 1/4, the slope is minus 0.8, for 1/8 is minus 0.89, for 1/16 is minus 0.94, and for 1/1000 it's minus 0.999. As you can see, this
converges to minus 1. The derivative here is minus 1. This is negative 1
times 1 squared, which is actually the value. Because when f of x
equals x inverse, then the derivative is
minus 1x to the minus 2. Let's actually do the
calculation to confirm this. Delta f over Delta is going to be x plus Delta x
inverse minus x inverse divided by Delta x. Let's actually write this
as one over x plus Delta x minus 1 over x over Delta x. Let's expand the one on
the top as x minus Delta x plus x divided by x
plus Delta x times x. Some things cancel out, this plus x and this
minus x cancel out. We can multiply and
divide by Delta x and we get minus 1 over x
squared plus Delta x. Now as Delta x goes to 0, well, the one on top stays put, the x^2 stays put, but this goes to 0. Therefore, we have 1
minus 1 over x squared. If f of x equals x inverse, then f prime of x equals minus
1 times x to the minus 2. Let's take a look at what
we've learned so far. The derivative of x squared, x cubed and x inverse, we've already calculated
the first one is 2x^1, the second one is 3x squared, and the third one is
minus 1x to the minus 2. Now, can you spot a pattern? These three actually follow
a really nice pattern. That works for any
power function. Take a look at the exponent. The exponent goes here in the derivative as a
multiplication factor. Then you subtract one from the exponent and you
get the new exponent. So x squared becomes
2x to the minus 1, x cubed becomes 3x
squared, and x inverse, so x to the minus 1 becomes
minus 1x to the minus 2. What do you think
happens with x^n? Well, with x to the n, the exponent of n
comes down and it becomes nx to the new
exponent is n minus 1, so nx^n minus 1. If you have any power function, for example, x^100, the
derivative is 100x^99. If it's x to the minus 100, the derivative is minus
100x to the minus 101.

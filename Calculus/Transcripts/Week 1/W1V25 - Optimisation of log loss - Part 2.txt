In the previous video, you found the optimal coin
to win at again. But if you look closely, what we did was exactly
machine learning. It was finding the best
model for a dataset. What was the dataset?
The 10 coin flips, which are seven heads
followed by three tails, and the model was the coin. The model is a coin that lands in heads with probability
P and in tails with probability one minus
p. What you did was finding the model that most likely fits the
dataset on the left. How do you find that model? You minimize the log
loss and obtained that the optimal p is 0.7. Now the question is, why did that log loss have a logarithm? Why couldn't we simply solve the derivative
of a big product? Well, one reason is that
derivative products are hard, whereas derivative sums is easy. Of course, if it's a
product of two things, you can use the product rule. But what do you do for three
things or four things, or many things like this? You have to iterate the product rule and
it gets really messy. The derivative of
this function over here is actually this formula. That's something that is
too hard to work out. If there's an easier way, we should always take it, if we take the logarithm, then we get this
derivative over here; 6 over p plus 2 over
1 minus p et cetera. That's much cleaner. We do get some denominators, and that's because of
the logarithm because the derivative of the
logarithm of p is 1 over p. But denominators are
a small price to pay to not have to work out the
formula on the left. But that's not the only
reason we use logarithms. Another reason why we use
logarithms is because the product of tiny
things is tiny. Imagine if you have a
probability that is the product of 1,000
probabilities. That's the product of 1,000
numbers, between 0 and 1. That number could
be really small and maybe a computer is not able
to handle a number so small. On the other hand, if
it's the logarithm, the logarithm of a
very small number is a very large negative number and computers can
handle those numbers. In short, anytime in machine learning that you have a very complicated product, think of using the logarithm. It may simplify it a lot, especially if you're
taking derivatives.

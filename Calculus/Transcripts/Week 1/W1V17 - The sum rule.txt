So now that you know the scalar
multiplication rule, the sum rule is just as simple. Imagine that you have a function f and it's expressed as the sum
of two functions g and h. So what is the derivative of f? Well, it's simply the derivative
of g plus the derivative of h. I'd like to imagine the sum
rule in the following way. Imagine that there's a boat and
there's a kid inside the boat. And the boat moves and
the child also runs inside the boat. So the boat moves a distance let's say of
10, and the child moves a distance of 2. And we're going to keep
track with variables XB for the distance that the boat moves and
XC for the distance that the child moves. So if they're moving
in the same direction, what is the distance that the child
moves with respect to the earth? Well, that distance is
12 because it's 10 + 2. It's the distance that the boat moves plus
the distance that the child moves inside the boat. Now, that's with distances. But what happens with velocities? So let's do a quiz. Let's say that the speed of the boat
is 0.6 meters per second and the speed of the child inside
the boat is 0.05 meter per second. And they're both traveling
in the same direction. So here is a question, what is the speed
of the child with respect to the earth? So if you answered 0.65 meters per
second then you are correct because velocities can be added if they
are taken in the same direction. And that's pretty much the sum rule. It says, if distances can be added
then velocities can also be added, means that it functions can be added
then their derivatives can be added. So let's look at it with the plot. Here is a plot of time in the horizontal
axis and distance in the vertical axis. And this is how the child
moves inside the boat. This is how the boat moves. And this is the sum of the two which
is how the child moves with respect to the earth. So let's look at some slopes. Here is some point in time and we're
going to take some small interval delta t. And we're going to calculate the average
velocity over that interval for the child, for the boat, and for the sun. So for this we take the horizontal
step to be delta t and the vertical step to be the distance. So these distances are going to be XC for
child, XB for boat, and X total for the sum. Now we know that X total is
XB + XC because these two distances add two X total. So if we divide everything
by the same delta t, we obtain that the velocities add. So V total is equal to VB for
the boat plus VC for the child. And now all you need to do is let delta t
go to zero and you get the derivatives. So if you have three functions f1,
f2 and f1 + f2, the derivative of f1 at
a point is f1 one prime of x. The derivative of f2 at that
same point x is f2 prime of x. And what's the derivative of the sum? Well, since f is f1 + f2, then f prime is f1 prime plus f2 prime. And the slope over here is going
to be the sum of the slopes. And that's the sum rule.

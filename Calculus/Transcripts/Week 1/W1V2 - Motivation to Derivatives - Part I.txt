When I think of a derivative the first thing that comes
to my mind is velocity. Let's say for example,
that you're in a car and you go 100
kilometers in one hour. That means your
average velocity was 100 kilometers per hour. However, maybe you started fast, then you went slow,
then you stopped, then you went really fast, then maybe went reverse at some point so this
velocity is not constant. The question is, at
a given instant, what is the velocity
at that instant? That's called the
instantaneous velocity. That is precisely
what a derivative is. A derivative is the
instantaneous rate of change of a function. In this case, the function is distance and its
derivative is velocity. Let's add some numbers
to this example to understand the concept of
the derivative more clearly. Imagine here that you are
in the car traveling on a straight road and you have a speedometer that
tells you the velocity. Now remember from
physics that speed equals distance traveled
divided by the time elapsed. Unfortunately, the
speedometer breaks. But now you have an app that tells you the distance
you have traveled, and you also happen to have
a calculator in your hand. You'd drive for one
minute and you're able to generate
a table of values showing the distance
you traveled every five seconds
for one minute. Now here is the first quiz. The question is, is the car
moving at constant speed? The hint is take a look at the distance values
in the table. The car is not moving
at constant speed. You can see that between
10 and 15 seconds, which is a five-second interval, the car traveled 80 meters, but between 15 and 20 seconds, which is also a
five-second interval, the car traveled 63 meters. This tells us that
from 10-15 seconds, the car was traveling at
a faster average velocity than it was between
15 and 20 seconds. We can also conclude
that the speed of the car is not constant across
the one-minute interval. Great. You've determined that the car is not moving
at constant speed. Now here is the second quiz. Can you use this information to tell your velocity at
time 12.5 seconds? The hint is that velocity equals distance traveled
divided by time taken. Again, the quiz is,
can you or can you not use this information
to determine the exact velocity at 12.5
seconds? The answer is no. You cannot find the
velocity at time 12.5 seconds with the
data given on this table, you can find the
average velocity in the interval from 10-15, but you don't know what happened within that interval at 12.5, maybe you were going faster, maybe you are going slower
than the average velocity. However, there is one
thing you can find. You can find the
average velocity in the interval
from 10-15 seconds. That is the next quiz. What was the average
velocity of the car in the interval from 10-15 seconds? Let's draw a graph
for the points in the table to observe
what's going on. Let's zoom specifically
to the points 10, 122 and 15, 202 to find the slope at a point because the slope is going to be the
average velocity. Here is the graph and
here is the interval. The average velocity
between the time interval 10-15 seconds is
also the slope of the line that joins the
two points in the graph. Now velocity is calculated with the formula, distance over time. This is synonymous to the
formula for calculating slope, which is rise over run. This is the rise and
this is the run. In this case, the
rise is the change in distance and the run
is the change in time. This is because distance is on the vertical axis and time
in the horizontal axis. The distance traveled at
15 seconds is 202 meters, and the distance traveled at
10 seconds is 122 meters. The length of the
time interval is five and the length of the
distance interval is 80. Using the formula for
slope or velocity, we get 80 divided by 5
equals 16 meters per second. The slope of the line that
passes these two points is 16, which also translates to
the velocity of the car between those two points
is 16 meters per second. Now while the average velocity
between 10-15 seconds was a good estimate for the velocity at t equals 12.5 seconds, could we do better? Yes, we can if we had more
data about the distances of time close to t
equals 12.5 seconds. Let's say that we take more refined measurements,
one every second. Here you have a lot more data about the distances you
traveled every second and a specific distance you
covered from time t equals 10 all the
way to t equals 20. The data is shown in
this table over here. Here is another quiz. Can you find a better
estimate of the velocity of the car at time t equals 12.5
seconds using this data. Once again, we are
not able to find the exact velocity of
the car at 12.5 seconds. However, we have a way of making an even better guess than the previous one for
what this velocity is by taking the average
velocity between the interval of time between
12 seconds and 13 seconds. How do we calculate this? Well, if the slope is the change in distance over the
change in time, that's the velocity
of the interval, then this is the distance
at 13 minus the distance of 12 divided by the time
at 13 minus the time at 12. Distance at 13 is 170, distance at 12 is 155 and the time difference between
13 and 12 is one second. We get a slope of 15
meters per second. That's the velocity
for that interval. That is a much
better estimate for the instant velocity
at t equals 12.5. Now notice that we still don't have the estimate of
the velocity at 12.5. What would you do to
find this estimate? Well, you can just take finer and finer intervals
and the finer the intervals, the better the estimate is. That leads to the derivative
which is coming next.

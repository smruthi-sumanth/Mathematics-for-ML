Now that you know lines,
let's take a look at a slightly more complicated
function, quadratics. The simplest quadratic
is this parabola with equation y
equals x squared. Let's look at the derivatives. Notice that to the
left of the y-axis, these are negative
and to the right of the y-axis, these are positive. The formula for the derivative
is Delta f over Delta x, as Delta x goes to 0. Now, Delta f is the change
in y or the change in f, which is x plus Delta x
squared minus x squared. Before we do this formally, let's take a look at an example. What happens when x equals 1, then y is x squared,
which is also 1? Let's take a look
at some secants, calculate their
slope, and with that, we calculate the slope
of the tangent line. Let's start with a Delta x of 1. That means an interval of
length 1 horizontally. What is Delta f
when Delta x is 1? Well, it's the difference
between 4 and 1. 4 is 1 plus 1 squared
and 1 is 1 squared. This is 3 and what's the slope? Well, it's going to be 3
over 1 because Delta f is 3, Delta x is 1, and so 3 over 1 is 3, so the slope is 3. Now let's make the interval
smaller and see what happens. If we made this interval of
length 1 over 2 horizontally, then Delta x is 1 over 2. What is Delta y or Delta f? Well, it's going to be 1 plus 0.5 squared minus 1 squared, which is 2.25 minus 1, which is 1.25 and the slope
is 1.25 over one-half, and that is a value of 2.5. Now let's make an
interval even smaller. Let's make it a length
one-quarter horizontally. What is Delta f now? Well, Delta f is 1 plus 0.25
squared minus 1 squared, which is 0.56 and the
slope is 0.56 divided by one-quarter and that is 2.25. Now let's continue making
this interval smaller to see where the slope goes. It went from 3 to 2.5 to 2.25. Where do you think
it's going to go? Let's look at an interval
of length 1 over 8. The slope is going to be 2.125
and an interval of 1/16. The slope is 2.065.
Let's go extreme. Let's do an integral
of 1 over 1,000. The slope is going to be 2.001. It looks like the slope is going towards 2 and that's
actually the answer. The slope of the
tangent at 1 is 2. Notice that 2 is 2 times
one and that's actually the formula because the
derivative of x squared is 2x. Let's actually
calculate it formally. What's Delta f over Delta x? Well, Delta f, just like above, it's x plus Delta
x squared minus x squared divided by Delta x. Let's expand that and let's
cancel some things out. The x squared goes with
the minus x squared, the Delta x goes
with the delta x, and you get 2x plus Delta x. Now, what's the value
of 2x plus Delta x as Delta x goes to 0? Well, the 2x stays put
and this Delta x is 0. Therefore, the derivative df
over dx is going to be 2x. When f of x equals x squared, then the derivative is
f prime of x equals 2x.

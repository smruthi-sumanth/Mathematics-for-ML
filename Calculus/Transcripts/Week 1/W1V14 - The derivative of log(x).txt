In the previous
video, you learned the exponential function e^x, where e is the Euler number and you learned the
property that it has, which is that the
derivative of e^x is e^x. In this video,
you're going to use that and the inverse
function rule in order to calculate the derivative of the logarithmic function and you're going to see that
it's actually very simple. But before we get
the derivatives, let's look at
what's a logarithm. Imagine that you want
to find a number such that e to that number equals 3. That number is precisely
the logarithm of 3. That actually works
for any number x. If I want to find
the number such that e raised to
that number is x, that number is logarithm of x. We also call them
natural logarithm. You may see in other places, logarithms in other
bases such as 2 or 10, but in this course,
it's always going to be base e or the natural logarithm. Now, the fact that e
to logarithm of x is x means that the function f of
x equals e^x has an inverse, which is logarithm of y. F inverse of y is
the logarithm of y because e to the
logarithm of x is x and logarithm of e^y is y. Now let's plot them. On the left we have
the plot of e^x and on the right we have the
plot of logarithm of y. As usual, the left plot has a horizontal axis x and the right plot has a
horizontal axis y. Let's look at some points
in the plot left and their corresponding points in
the plot in the right. These correspond to
each other because recall the fact that these
functions are inverses means that if we reflect one about the line with
equation y equals x, we get the other one
because logarithm of x is the inverse of e^x. Now, let's take a look
at the derivatives. We're going to use the result
for inverses in order to calculate the derivative
of logarithm of x and you're going to see that
it's actually very simple. Let's take one
point, for example, on the left we have 2, 7.39. Recall that 7.39 is e squared. That means that on the
plot on the right, we're going to have
the point 7.39, 2, which is e squared, 2. The slope of this tangent is the one we're going
to find and we're going to use this one over here. Recall that the slope on the right is 1 over the slope on the left, that's
what we're going to use. The slope on the left is
f prime of x equals e^x, that's the derivative, because recall that
the derivative of e^x is e^x, therefore, because x is 2, the slope here is f prime of 2, which is e^2 or e squared. That's precisely 7.39. The height at 2 is 7.39 and the slope of the tangent
at 2 is also 7.39. Now, what's the slope on
the graph in the right? Well, because it's the
reciprocal of e squared, then it's 1 over e squared. This tangent, the
line on the right, the slope is 1 over e squared. Notice that e squared is y, therefore g prime of
y is simply 1 over y. Therefore, the derivative
of logarithm is 1 over y. Let's do this mathematically, using the result frame
versus d over dy of f inverse of y is
1 over f prime of x. Now x is f inverse of y, so let's actually
write it like this. If you take the logarithm
function and you take the derivative
with respect to y, then you get 1 over f
prime of f inverse of y. Now, f prime is e^x and f inverse of y
is logarithm of y, so you get 1 over y. In other words,
the derivative of logarithm of y is 1 over y.

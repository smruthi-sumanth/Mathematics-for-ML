In this video, you're going to see
a slightly more complicated example of optimizing a function. The example consists on locating a house
in the perfect place, in order to minimize the cost of connecting
this house to several power lines. Now, why is this example important? Because the function you're minimizing is
very similar to the squared error, and the squared error is one of the most
important functions in machine learning. It is used to train linear regression
problems, and certain neural networks. So here is the problem. You have a number of power lines in
your area and you need to build a house somewhere, and you need to connect to
all of them for the best power supply. Now, connecting to these power grids is
expensive, because the further you are, the longer and
wider the cable that you need. So, for example, let's say you
want to connect to this power line and the distance between your house and
the power line is X meters. So the cost of connecting to this
power line is going to be X2, so that distance squared. And the goal is to minimize the cost
of connecting to all three power lines. So the question is, where should you build
your house in order to minimize this cost. So let's start with a very simple problem,
let's say that there's only one power line and you want to get the power
with the least amount of cost, where would you put the house? So if you set right by the power line,
then you are right. Because if the distance from
the power line is zero units, then the cost of connecting to the power
line is going to be 0 squared which is 0. So that's an easy problem, right? Let's try it with more power lines.

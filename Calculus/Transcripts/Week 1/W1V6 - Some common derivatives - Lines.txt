Our goal is to be
able to calculate the derivatives of most of
the functions that we know. Let's start with
the simple ones. What are the simple ones? Constant functions, linear
functions, quadratics, polynomial functions, exponential and
logarithmic functions, and the trigonometric functions. You're going to be glad
to know that these have very nice and
simple derivatives. Let's start with lines. The simplest line is
actually a constant, so a horizontal line. This function is such that
the height at every point, for example, x_0 and
x_1 is always the same, some constant c. The
c could be -173.5, any number as long as
is always the same. Now let's look, for example, at the derivative at x_0. This tangent line has the same
slope as the entire line. What is the slope? Well, the slope is
Delta y over Delta x. Now the change in y is always zero because y is always c, so it's always c minus c. Therefore the numerator
here is zero, and the denominator is not zero if we take x_0
different than x_1. So therefore, the
slope is always zero. We conclude that
a horizontal line or a constant always has
a derivative of zero. Now let's consider
some generic line that is not horizontal. It can have the equation
f of x equals a_x plus b, where a is the slope and
b is the y-intercept. What is the derivative
for this function? Well, this derivative
is very simple. Let's take a point,
for example, this one. We're going to
calculate it by taking any other point and
looking at Delta x, looking at Delta
y and calculating the slope Delta y over Delta x. Now this is rise over run, so it's going to be a,
which is the slope. Notice that as the second point is closer to the first one, well, the tangent stays
on the same slope for the same reason as what happened with
the constant line. When you have a line,
the tangent that every point has the same
slope as the entire line. This line has a slope of eight. Therefore, the equation
f of x equals a_x plus b of a line has a derivative
f prime of x of a. If you want to see
the math happening, well, let's look at the points. This point has equation x, ax plus b. Those are
the coordinates. This point has coordinates
x plus Delta x, a x plus Delta x b plus b. Therefore, when we
take the slope, it's Delta y over Delta x. That's the difference between this number and this
number, the Delta y. That's a_x plus Delta x
plus b minus a_x plus b. The denominator is Delta x. So a lot of things
cancel out here. This a _x cancels
out with this a_x. This b cancels out with this b, and then we have a times
Delta x over Delta x, the two delta x's cancel
out and the slope is a. Therefore, the
derivative of the line with equation a x plus
b is the slope a.

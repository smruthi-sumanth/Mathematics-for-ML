Now that you know the
sum rule, product rule, and scalar rule, you are
ready for the chain rule. It's probably the most
complicated in these rules, but if you look at it
from a certain angle, it can be pretty simple. Imagine that you have
a function h of t and to output of this function you want to apply
another function, g of t. You have a
composition of functions, and now you want to
take the derivative of this composition
of functions with respect to t. Let's say, you know dh over dt, the derivative of h
with respect to t. You also know the derivative
of g with respect to h. The derivative of the composition is simply
the product of these two. Now why is it called
the chain rule? Because you continue
composing functions. Let's say you want to
apply another function, f to the output of g and you want to take
this derivative, well, you need to know the
same there before, in addition to df over dg, and the product is the
desired derivative. Of course, as you can imagine,
you can continue composing more and more functions and
you're just going to get more terms in the product.
That's the chain rule. Now, with the Leibniz notation, the chain rule is pretty clear. But with the Lagrange notation, there is something to keep track of because it can
be a little tricky. Here it is again
for two functions. Now, what is dh over dt
in Lagrange notation is simply h prime of t.
What is the dg over dh? Well, it would be lovely
if it was g prime of t, but it's not g prime of t. It's g prime of whatever you put into the function g.
It's g prime of h of t, that's all we have
to keep track of, its g prime times h prime, except that you have to put the correct input
in the function. What happens with three
variables? Well, the same thing. Dh over dt is h prime of t. Dg over dh is g prime
of the input to g, which is h of t. Df over dg
is f prime of the input to f, which is g of h of t.
That is the chain rule. This is how I like
to see chain rule. Imagine that you're
driving your car again and you'll
feel of interests, so you're going to
go up a mountain, the base of the
mountain is pretty hot, but the top is pretty cold. As you drive up, you notice that the temperature is changing with respect to height and the rate of
change is dT over dh, where T keeps track of temperature and h
keeps track of height. But also as time changes, you drive up the mountain. Therefore, the height changes
with respect to time, and t keeps track of time. So the rate of change of height respect to time is dh over dt. Now notice that as time passes, you drive up and as you
drive up it gets colder. Therefore, temperature also
changes with respect to time and the rate of
change is dT of the dt. When the chain rule says, is that you can find the third one from the
first and the second. If you know d temperature over d height and d
height over d time, then their product is d
temperature over d time, is pretty much which
chain rule says. But let's look at a plot
to understand this deeper. We're going to plot
in three-dimensions. One axis is going to be time, the other one height, and the other one temperature. In the bottom plane,
there's the function h, which dictates how height change with respect
to temperature. In this plane over
here at the back, it's the function t
that keeps track of how temperature keeps changing
with respect to height. Now, as time changes a
small amount Delta t, then height changes a
small amount Delta h, and then temperature
changes a small amount Delta T and the way to
see it is like this. Let's say here at
this point in time. The bottom plot tells you that this point in
time corresponds to this height and the top
plot tells you that this height corresponds
to this temperature. If you make a small
change forwards in time, then now you're at a
different time spot. That yields a higher altitude. That higher altitude
is changed by Delta h, a small amount of altitude. That Delta h creates
a small change, Delta temperature, because now it gets colder
because you drove up, and so Delta t implies Delta
h implies Delta T. Now, these are very tiny numbers, Delta t, Delta h, and Delta T. This expression
holds Delta T over Delta t is Delta h over Delta t times Delta T
over Delta H. Again, these are numbers
so I can cancel Delta h on top and bottom. But now as I let
Delta t go to zero, Delta h also goes to zero
and Delta T goes to zero, and so this number in the
left becomes dT over dt. This one over here
becomes dT over dh, and this one over here
becomes dh over dt. That's pretty much
the chain rule.

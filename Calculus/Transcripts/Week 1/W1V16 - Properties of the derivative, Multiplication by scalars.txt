So far, you've learned derivatives of some
simple functions. In order to find the derivatives of more complicated functions, what you have to use this
certain rules in order to piggyback from the simple ones into more complicated
calculations. The rules you're
going to learn next, are multiplication by scalar, sum rule, product rule, and the chain rule for
compositions of functions. So the first rule is
multiplication by scalar. Let's say you have a
function f and it's four times a function g. If you want to take
the derivative of f, that means is just going to
be four times the derivative of g. That works for
every value of four. If it's actually a constant
c can be any constant. Then if f is equal to c times g, then f prime is equal
to c times g prime. Let's take a look at
why this happens. Consider the function
y equals x squared drawn over here and let's
take twice that function, so 2 x squared, therefore, the function
gets multiplied by two. Let's look at some points. On the left you
have the point 1, 1 and the point 2, 4 because 2 squared is 4. The slope of the
secant line, well, it's rise over run
where the run is one, which is 2 minus 1, and the rise is three
because that's 4 minus 1. This slope is 3 over
1, which is three. Now let's look at the
corresponding points in the function in the right, which as we said, it's doubled
the function in the left. The point corresponding
to 1, 1 is 1, 2 and the point
corresponding to 2, 4 is 2, 8 and let's
calculate the slope. Well, the run is the same as the run
in the previous one, which is 2 minus 1 equals 1. But the rise is double the previous one because
on the plot on the right, everything gets doubled in
the vertical direction. The 4 minus 1 equals
3 on the left, which is the right, becomes an 8 minus 2
equals 6 on the right and so the slope multiplies
by 2 because the numerator multiples by 2 and the denominator
stayed the same. Therefore, if the
function multiplies by 2, all these slopes get
multiplied by 2. Now, if you take the limit, if you let the point on the right move towards
the point in the left, you still have that all
the slopes multiply by 2. Therefore, the derivative or
the slope of the tangent, which over here is two as we saw before, now becomes four. In other words, if we take a function and multiply it by 2, the derivative gets
multiplied by 2. This happens for every value. For example if we have
a function like this, and we multiply it by c, which means the height on the right is c times
the height on the left. That every point, then
the derivative gets multiplied by c. If we
have a point over here, x, y with slope f prime of
x for the tangent line. On the right, the point corresponding to
that is going to be xcy and the slope is going
to be c times f prime of x. Because if you think about it, the plot on the right
is obtained from the plot left by basically
putting your hands on top and bottom and
stretching it by a factor of c. That is the multiplication
by scalar rule.

And next, I'm going to show you
a pretty interesting rule for determinants of inverses,
one that you may all ready be suspecting. And the way you can figure
this out is with a quiz. So please find the determinants
of these two matrices. And the determinants are 0.2 and 0.125. Now recall that this matrix over
here is actually the inverse of the matrix we've been using for
mostly examples. This matrix has determinant 5, and
as you've recently calculated, this matrix has determinant 0.2,
which is exactly one fifth or the multiplicative inverse of 5. Now, the second matrix is
the inverse of this one over here, which has determinant 8. And you've calculated this one
to have determinant of 0.125, which is the multiplicative inverse of 8,
precisely. And for the last one,
if you recall from a few videos ago, this matrix over here
doesn't have an inverse. And it's actually a singular
matrix of determinant 0, and it has no inverse and
precisely 0 has no inverse. So a nice coincidence is spot over here, which is that it seems that
the determinant of an inverse matrix is the inverse of the determinant
of the matrix. And that is precisely the case
when the matrix is invertible, then the determinant of the inverse is
one over the determinant of the matrix. And why is this? Well, let's check. We know by the product formula that
the determinant of a product is equal to the determinant of
A times the determinant of B. Now let B be actually A inverse. So the determinant of A times A inverse
is equal to the determinant of A times the determinant of A inverse. Now AA inverse is
precisely identity matrix. So the determinant of the identity
matrix is determined of A times determinant of A inverse. Now the determinant of
the identity matrix is always 1. And therefore that means that
the determinant of A inverse is precisely 1 over the determinant of A. Now why is the determinant
of the identity matrix 1? Well, let's actually calculate it. Notice that for a two by two matrix is
1 times 1 minus 0 times 0, which is 1. And I'll leave you the exercise of taking
a big matrix and identity matrix and actually calculating the determinant and
verifying for yourself that it's always going to be 1.

In week 1 of this course, you'll learn what singular and
non-singular matrices are. Since matrices correspond
to linear transformations, then linear transformations
can also be singular and non-singular
and you'll be pleasantly surprised to see that there's a very nice way to identify linear
transformations that are singular and non-singular. Even the rank of a linear
transformation can be identified easily.
Let me show you how. You already saw previously how the matrix with entries 3, 1, 1, and 2 corresponds to the linear transformation that sends the basis on the
left to the basis on the right and equivalently sends this blue grid to this
orange grid over here, this is also called
the change of basis. This is in sense the blue
square basis on the left into the orange
parallelogram basis on the right but one
special thing is this, the orange grid covers every
single point on the plane. It turns out that this is
precisely the trait of a non-singular
transformation and the resulting points after
multiplying by a matrix, cover the entire plane and the transformation is
non-singular and vice versa. The points that are covering the right are called the
image of the transformation. To see this, let's look an example of a singular
matrix such as this one, the matrix with
entries 1, 1, 2, 2. Notice that if you multiply
the matrix by the vector 0, 0, you get 0, 0 as usual. If you multiply it by the
vector 1, 0, you get 1, 2. Now notice what happens if I multiply it by
the vector 0, 1, I get again 1, 2 and if I multiply it by 1, 1, I get 2, 4 which means that the square basis on the left, doesn't go to a
parallelogram or it does, but it's a degenerate
parallelogram, it's actually a line segment
and there's a problem because the grid on the left doesn't get sent to
the entire plane, it gets sent to this line because when we had
a parallelogram, no matter how thin
it was able to cover the entire
plane on the right but if our parallelogram is flat and it's only
one line segment, then that can only cover the
orange line on the right, it cannot cover
the entire plane. In summary, when a matrix is singular, this thing happens, you're not covering the
entire plane on the right, you're only covering a
small portion of it. In this case, you're
covering a line. Now, let's look at a very singular matrix with
entries 0, 0, 0, 0. This matrix has any vector with any coordinates into
the vector 0, 0, which is the origin, so the entire plane gets sent to that orange
point in the origin. That matrix is definitely very singular because the image
is not even a plane, it's not even a line,
it's actually a point. Here's the summary,
the first matrix sends the whole plane
to the whole plane, so it is non-singular. The second one sends the whole
plane to simply a line so it's singular and the third one sends the whole
plane to a point, so it's even more singular. Notice that the dimension of
the image of the first one is two and that's precisely
the rank of this matrix. The dimension of
the image here is one because it's
a line and that's the rank of this matrix and the dimension here of
the point is zero, which is the rank of
the third matrix. That's another way
to calculate rank. The dimension of the image of
the linear transformation.

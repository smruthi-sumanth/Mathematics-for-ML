A fundamental concept of linear
algebra is the concept of a basis. You've actually seen basis many
times through this course in several different ways, but this week you
learn how to identify them and use them to your advantage. So what do we mean by a basis? In the previous week, you learn that
a matrix can be seen as a linear transformation from the plane
to the plane, which sends this fundamental square into this
parallelogram and both were called basis. Now, why are they called basis? Well, in reality, all that matters here
is not the four points of the square of the parallelogram, but
the two vectors that define it. Namely those two vectors
coming from the origin. Those are the ones that are referred
from now on as a basis. The main property of a basis is that
every point in the space can be expressed as a linear combination
of elements in the basis. What do I mean by that? Well, let's say we have
these two vectors and I'm telling you that those
two are a basis, why? Well, pick any point in space,
say this one. Can we get to that point only walking in
the two directions defined by the basis? Well, of course we do. We can do it this way or
this way or this other way. There are many ways to do this. Actually, there's infinitely many since
you don't have to take unit steps, you can walk in tiny
fractions of steps and you can even walk backwards in
that direction if you want. So this is one of the possible basis for
the plane. Can you help me think of some more? Well, there are lots and lots,
for example, look at this basis. I could get to any point, for example,
this point using those two directions. Here's one way, I walk in this way,
and then in this one. Remember that I can walk
backwards if I want to. So those two vectors also form a basis. Do these two vectors form basis? Yes, they do, I can walk like this and
then like this to get to the point. So as a matter of fact,
pretty much any two vectors form a basis. Now it's almost hard to think of what's
not a basis, what would be a non-basis. So here's an example,
let's take the two vectors over here. These two vectors,
I can arrive for example, to this point over here, but
I could not arrive to this point over here by walking in those two directions
because I only have one direction. So I really can only cover that line,
I cannot cover the entire plane. So, anything that comprises two vectors
that go in the same direction and they could be opposites or
they could go in the same direction, but as long as they belong to the same line,
the two vectors do not form a basis. So that is what a basis is and
what a non-basis is

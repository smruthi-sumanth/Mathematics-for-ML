Now that you know what a
basis of the plane is, the following question arises. Can something not be a
basis of the plane but still be a basis for
some other space? What exactly
constitutes a basis? For this, let me introduce
the concept of a span. The span of a set of vectors
is simply the set of points that can be reached
by walking in the direction of these
vectors in any combination. For example, you've
seen that the span of these two vectors
is the plane as you can get to any point in the plane by walking in
these two directions. Likewise, the span of these two vectors is also the plane. May be a while to
get to many points, but one can use only
these two directions. These two vectors, however, don't span the plane
because as you saw before, not every point can be reached by walking in these
two directions. They're the same direction. What set do they span? Any point in this line can
be reached by walking in the directions of the vectors. The span of these two
vectors is that line. What about these two
that are at an angle of 180 degree apart? The span is again the
line that contains them because you can get
to every point on that line by walking on
these two directions. What about this one vector? What's the span of one vector? The span is the line that contains it and
goes to the origin because that's the set of points that you can reach by
walking in that direction. Here's a question.
Do these two vectors form a basis of this line? What do you think? The
answer is actually no. The reason is that
a basis needs to be a minimal spanning set. Here there are too many vectors. See any one of those two
vectors spans a line. The two are one too many. A basis is a minimal
spanning set, so each one of them separately
is a basis of that length. But the two of them
are not a basis. They're a spanning set, but they're not a basis. Is this a basis of something? Yes, that is the
basis of this line. As a matter of fact, any vector that starts at the
origin and goes in that same direction is also
a basis for that line. In summary, a basis is
a minimal spanning set. The vector on the left
forms a basis on this line. But these two vectors don't
because they are too many. This happens also for
higher dimensions. Let's look at this set. This set forms a basis of
the plane because it spans the plane because we can get to any point by walking in
those two directions. But if we remove any of them, they don't span
the plane anymore. Now they just span one line. However, this set
of vectors over here do not form a
basis of the plane. They span the plane because any point in the
plane can be reached by walking in some combination
of these three directions, but they're too
big to be a basis. Any subset of two of these
three vectors is a basis, but the third one is redundant. So that's not a basis. Notice something interesting
and is that the length of the basis is the space of
the dimension of the plane. Notice something interesting,
which is that the length of the basis of a space is the
dimension of that space. On the left, the line
has a basis of length one and it has a dimension of one because line
has dimension one. On the right, the
plane has a basis of length two formed by two vectors and the plane has a
dimension of two. This implies that any
basis of any space actually has the same number of elements in any other basis. I encourage you to take
a look at, for example, a three-dimensional
space and imagine how would a basis look there.

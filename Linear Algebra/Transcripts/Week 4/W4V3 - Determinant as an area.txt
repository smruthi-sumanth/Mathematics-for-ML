In the first week
of this course, you'll learn what a
determinant is and how it's related to the singularity or non singularity of a matrix. You'll be pleased to see that in the linear transformation, the determinant is very nicely explained as an area,
or as a volume. When this area or volume is 0, then the matrix is singular. Allow me to show you how. Take a look at the matrix
again with the entries 3, 1, 1 and 2. It's determinant is 3 times 2 minus 1 times 1, which is 5. Now recall that this matrix
sends the blue square on the left into the orange
parallelogram on the right. Now, take a look at the area
of the square, it is 1. The area of the parallelogram, I encourage you to
calculate it by adding and subtracting
areas of triangles. It turns out that
these area is 5, which is precisely
the determinant. That is always the case, the determinant of the
matrix is the area of the image of the
fundamental basis formed by the unit
square on the left. What happens with a
singular transformation? Well, recall that in this
transformation over here, with determinant 1 times 2
minus 2 times 1 equals 0, the fundamental square gets sent to a very skinny
parallelogram. It's so skinny
that it's actually a line segment and the
line segment has area 0, which is precisely the
determinant of the matrix. Finally, for the very singular
transformation with entries 0,0,0,0 and obvious
determinant of 0, the transformation sends
a fundamental unit square to the point 0,0. This point has an area of 0 corresponding to the
determinant of 0. In summary, we got a non singular matrix
with determinant 5, just precisely the area of the image of the
fundamental square, then another singular
matrix with determinant 0, which is the area of the image
of the fundamental square, which is a line segment and another singular matrix
again with determinant 0, since the area of the image
of the fundamental square, this time is a point, is also 0. Now, here's something that
you may be wondering, what about negative
determinants? Notice that the matrix on
the right that's formed by permuting the two columns
on the matrix on the left. For that reason, it's got the negative determinant
of negative 5. Here's the small technicality. A parallelogram can have a
negative area depending on what order we take the two
basis vectors as follows. Notice that the matrix
with entries 1, 3, 2 and 1 sends the
vector with coordinates 1,0 to the vector
of coordinates 1,2, and the vector of
coordinates 0,1, to the vector of
coordinates 3,1. It's the same as
the other matrix, except in the opposite order. It turns out that by
that small technicality, we say that the area of the
parallelogram is negative, if we take the vectors in
counterclockwise order and positive if we take
them in clockwise order. Therefore, the area on the
square on the left is 1, but the area on the
parallelogram on the right, is going to be minus 5. But notice that a
determinant being positive or negative
doesn't actually affect the singularity
of the matrix and so all the matters for the
matrix to be non singular, is that the determinant
is different than 0.

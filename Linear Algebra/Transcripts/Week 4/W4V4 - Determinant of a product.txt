Now that you know what a determinant
means in a linear transformation, you'll be able to see that the determinant
of a product of matrix follows a really nice rule, check it out. So here's a product of matrices
that I encourage you to check for yourself and make sure that it works. Now, what are the determinant
of this matrix? The first one has determinant 5,
which is 3 times 2 minus 1 times 1. The second one has determinant 3,
which is 1 times 1 minus 1 times minus 2. And the third one has determinant 15,
which is 1 times 3 minus 4 times minus 3. Notice that, 5 times 3 is 15. Could that always be the case that the
determinant of the product of matrices is equal to the product of the determinants? And you'll be happy to see
that this is always true. The determinant of AB is equal
to determinant of A times the determinant of B. Now, if you try to work it out with
matrices, it can be a little messy. I like to think of it in
a much more simple way, which is with linear transformations. So the first matrix 3 1 1 2. We've seen it already and it's
the matrix that sends this fundamental basis to this basis over here and
the 5 is the area of the parallelogram. That means that this transformation
actually blows up the areas by 5. The second matrix has a determinant of 3. And if you work it out is the one
that sends this fundamental basis here into this parallelogram here,
that has area 3. And the 3 correspond to the determinant, that means that this transformation
blows up the areas by 3. Now, that happens with everything. So, this parallelogram here goes to
this parallelogram over here with area 15 because what the transformation
does is no matter what area you have, it blows it up by a factor
of the determinant. So if you consider the combination of
these two linear transformations first, you're blowing up the areas by 5 and
then you're blowing up the areas by 3. So you're blowing them up by
5 times 3 which is 15 and that is what this transformation does. It blows up the area of the fundamental
basis of everyone into a basis of area 15 and therefore, the determinant is 15 which
is a product of the two determinants. So here's a quiz to test your intuition,
what would you say about the product of a singular and
a non singular matrix in any order? Would it be singular? Would it be non-singular? Or could it be either one? Well, let's say that A is non singular and
B is singular. So we know that determinant of
AB is determinant of A times determinant of B but
determinant of B is zero because B is singular. So determinant of AB has to be 0
because its determinant of A times 0. Therefore, AB is singular, so
if one matrix is singular then that matrix multiplied with any other matrix
in the world is also singular. Now, it's quite logical
when we think of numbers, see if you have any number doesn't
matter which number, let's say 5. When multiplied by 0, it becomes 0. So if you have any matrix when
multiplied by a singular matrix, it becomes a singular
matrix because whatever its determinant is when multiplied by 0,
it becomes 0. And geometrically, doesn't make sense. If you multiply two matrix for example, this one over here which is non singular
with this one over here which is singular. Well, the second matrix being singular
means it sends everything into a part of a line. And that means that when you combine them
then it sends the fundamental basis into some segments. So it has this determinant 0
because this segment has area 0. So in other words, whatever area you
haven't left, it gets blown up by 0.

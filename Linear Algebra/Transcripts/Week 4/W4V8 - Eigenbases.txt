Now that you know
what a basis is, you should know that some basis are more
useful than others. In particular,
there's one basis to rule them all called
the eigenbasis. The eigenbasis is
tremendously useful, in particular for machine
learning applications such as principal component analysis,
as we mentioned before. Here's how eigenbasis work. Let's look at the
linear transformation corresponding to the
matrix with entries 2, 1, 0, and three. We're going to see how it acts with respect to the
fundamental basis. This basis has two vectors, the vector 1, 0, which when you
multiply by the matrix, you see that it
gets the vector 2, 0 and the vector 0, 1, which when you put
it in the product, you get the vector 1, 3. This square on the left goes to this parallelogram on the right and the rest of
the plane follows. This is also called a change of coordinates or a change of basis because that's
exactly what you're doing. You're going from the
square coordinates in the left to the parallelogram
coordinates in the right. But that's something
you've already seen. Now let's get to something
more interesting. The choice of the square
was very arbitrary. Let's actually pick
a different basis and see what happens. Let's pick again the vector 1, 0 that goes to the vector 2, 0. As a second element
of that basis, let's pick this vector 1, 1 just to see what happens. That goes to the vector 3, 3. This parallelogram goes
to this parallelogram. What is special here? Notice that the sides of the two parallelograms
are parallel to the corresponding
one in the other basis. That is very special. Notice that the rest of
the plane also follows. Because these sites
are parallel, then what we're doing
to the plane is we're stretching by
two in this direction, the horizontal direction, and stretching by three in
this diagonal direction. This is a very special basis. It only consists of
two stretchings. That is what's called
an eigenbasis. It's a very special way of looking at a linear
transformation with respect to a basis that sends a parallelogram to
another parallelogram with sides parallel
to the original one. Why is that useful? Let's say that you want to find the image of the point 3, 2. You can multiply it by
the matrix and get 8, 6, which is over here. But you can also
express that point as a combination of elements in the basis. What
does that mean? That we find a path
to get to that point using the two directions
that we have. Now the linear transformations
corresponds to stretching the
horizontal vector by two and the vertical
vector by three. This really simplifies the
linear transformation. It just consists of
two stretchings. The two vectors in the
basis are gonna be called the eigenvectors
and the stretching factor, the two and the three, are going to be
called eigenvalues. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are
tremendously important in linear algebra because they really simplify
our calculations.

Now that you've learned what
a system of linear equations is and when they are
singular or non-singular, it is time for some
visualizations. It turns out that linear
equations can easily be visualized as lines
in the coordinate plane. This is because you
have two variables. If you have three variables, they are planes in space. If you have more variables, they look like
high-dimensional space. But let's not worry
about that yet. Since linear equations can
be represented as lines, then systems of linear
equations can be represented as arrangements
of lines in the plane. This way, you can visualize
their solutions and their singularity or non-singularity
in a much clear way. How can you visualize,
for example, the equation a plus b
equals 10 as a line? First, let us get
a grid in which the horizontal
axis represents a, which is the price of an apple, and the vertical
axis represents b, which is the price of a banana. Now let's look at solutions to this equation a
plus b equals 10. In other words, pairs of
numbers that add to 10. What you'll do is put
them in this plot. Two obvious solutions
are the point 10, 0. The a coordinate, the
price of an apple, is 10 and the b coordinate, the price of a banana, is
zero because 10 plus 0 is 10. Another obvious solution
is the point 0, 10 where a is zero
and b equals 10. Other solutions are the point 4, 6 because 4 plus 6 equals 10. This is a equals 4 and b
equals 6 or the point 8, 2 where a equals and b equals 2. Notice that you can also
have negative solutions, for example minus 4,14. Now, this makes no sense
in the world problem because an apple
cannot cost minus 4. But these are two
numbers that add to 10, minus 4 plus 14 equals 10. This is a legitimate
solution to the equation. You can also have negative
solutions like 12, minus 2. Now notice that all these
points form a line. In fact, every single point in this line is solution
to the equation. You can then associate
the equation a plus b equals 10 with this line. Now let's do another equation. Say the equation a
plus 2b equals 12. That means points for which
the horizontal coordinate plus two times the vertical
coordinate add to 12. Some solutions for this
equation are the point 0,6 since 0 plus 2
times 6 equals 12. The point 12,0 because
12 plus 2 times 0 is 12. The point 8,2 because 8
plus 2 times 2 is 12. Again, negative solutions
like minus 4,8 for example, because minus 4 plus
2 times 8 is 12. Again, these points form a line and every point in the line is a solution
to this equation. The line is associated
with the equation a plus 2b equals 12. One small aside,
be familiarized with the notions of slope and
y-intercept in a line. The slope is the
ratio of rise over run which in the line
on the left is minus 1. As for every unit you
move to the right, the line moves one unit down. The down is the
minus the negative. For the line on the right, the slope is minus a half because for every
unit you move to the right, the line moves half a unit down. For the y-intercept for
a line on the left, it is 10 as this
is the height of the intersection
between the line and the vertical y-axis, and for the line on
the right it is six. Now here's what's interesting. Each equation is
associated to a line. What happens with the
system of two equations? Well, the system of two
equations is simply associated with two
lines in the same plane. Notice that these two lines
cross at a unique point. The point 8,2 for a
equals 8 and b equals 2. The point is precisely
unique solution to that system of equations. This is exactly
what we got before algebraically but now we
can see it geometrically. Now that we know how to
plot the equation of line a plus b equals 10,
let's try another one. How about 2a plus 2b equals 20? Well, notice that
that line still goes through the point 0,10 and 10,0. As the line is defined by only two points then the line is exactly the same as the one with equation a
plus b equals 10. We called that a
few lessons ago, you learned that equation
a plus b equals 10 and 2a plus 2b was 20 carry
the same information. This is a visual
confirmation for that. Now, when we want to find the solution to this
set of equations, there is no single
intersection point. Instead, the two lines
overlap each other, they are the same line. What happens now is
that every point that belongs to both lines is a solution to the
set of equations a plus b equals 10 and
2a plus 2b equals 20. That means we have infinitely
many solutions because every point in that
line is a solution. Finally, let's look in
our system of equations, the one with equations
a plus b equals 10 and 2a plus 2b equals 24. Let's plot the one on the right. Notice that the lines
of equation 2a plus 2b equals 24 goes through
the point 0,12 and 12,0 because 2 times 0 plus
2 times 12 is 24 and 2 times 12 plus 2 times 0 is 24 and therefore it has to
be this line over here. Is very similar to the
original line except it's translated up by two units. When we try to get
the solutions to this set of equations,
take a look. The system of two equations
is simply associated to these two lines in the same
plane that are parallel. Parallel lines never meet so there are no solutions
to this system. There's no point that
belongs to both the lines. The system has no solutions. Let's now summarize what
you've seen in this video. There are three
systems of equations. The first one has
equations a plus b equals 10 and a
plus 2b equals 12. The second one has equations a plus b equals 10
and 2a plus 2b equals 20 and the third
one has equations a plus b equals 10 and
2a plus 2b equals 24. Here are the plots
for the three. The first one corresponds
to two lines that intersect at a unique 8,2. That's the unique
solution to the system. The second one corresponds to
two lines that are exactly the same line corresponding to a system that has
infinitely many solutions. The third one corresponds
to two parallel lines that never meet which means the
system has no solutions. We can use the exact same
nomenclature as we used with equations and with
systems of sentences. Since the first system
has a unique solution, it is complete and it is non-singular because every line brings something
new to the table. The second system has infinitely many solutions
because the second line is exactly the same
as the first one so the system is redundant
and singular. The second line brings
nothing new to the table because it's exactly the
same as the first line. Finally, since the third system corresponds to two
lines and never meet, it means the second equation
contradicts the first one. We have no solutions. Therefore, the system is
contradictory and singular. Now you're ready
for another quiz. Problem 1 says, which of the following plots
correspond to the systems of equations 3a plus 2b equals
8 and 2a minus b equals 3? Problem 2 says, by looking
at the plot for Problem 1, do you conclude that the
system is singular or non-singular? The
answer is this. In order to plot these lines, you can notice
that the line with equation 3a plus 2b goes through the point 0,4 and 8/3,0 and the line with
equation 2a minus b equals 3 goes to the point 0 minus 3 and 3/2,0. Notice that the two
lines cross at the point 2,1 which is precisely the unique solution to
the system of equations. That's a equals 2
and b equals 1. Since the two lines
intersect at a unique point, then the system is non-singular.

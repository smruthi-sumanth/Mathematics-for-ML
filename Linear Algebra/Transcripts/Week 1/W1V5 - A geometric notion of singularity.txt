Now that you learned how systems of linear
equations are represented by lines in the plane, and that non-singularity
equates to these lines in intersecting at a unique point,
I'm going to show you an even simpler way to visualize singularity and
non-singularity. It involves slightly
simplifying the system. Recall that these are the three
systems you've been studying, where system 1 has a unique solution. So it's complete and non-singular. System 2 has infinitely many solutions
so it's redundant and singular. And system 3 has no solution, so
it's contradictory and singular. Now forget for a moment about the system
being complete, redundant, or contradictory, and let's focus on
the singularity and non-singularity. And the reason for this is that these
are the terms we're going to be studying during the whole class. Note that system 2 and
3, the singular ones, are very similar since both
consists of parallel lines. Different lines in the system
to these lines are the same, and the system 3 they're spaced apart. But both are fundamentally different from
the non-singular system 1 since the system 1, the two lines are not parallel. So can you somehow contract systems 2 and
3 into one in order to really separate singular and
non-singular systems into two buckets? And the answer is yes. And the way to do this is to look at
the constants of the systems of equations. These constants are the numbers in
the equations that are not accompanying the variables A or B. For instance, the system 1,
they are 10 and 12. The system 2 they're 10 and 20. And the system 3 they're the 10 and
the 24. So let's turn all these constants for all these three systems into 0 and
see what happens to the plots. So when you turn these constants to 0,
the plots now become this, why? Because the new systems always
have the 0.00 as a solution, so they must pass by the origin. Notice that if I were to set A and B to be 0 in any of these equations,
the equations would work. So 00 is a solution to all of them. Now notice that system 1 is still
a pair of intersecting lines, so it still has a unique solution. So it's still complete and non-singular. System 2 is still a pair
of identical lines, so it still has infinite solutions,
so it's redundant and singular. But notice what happened to system 3,
it went from a pair of non-intersecting parallel
lines to a pair of identical lines. So now it has infinitely many
solutions instead of none. So it went from
contradictory to redundant. However, it stayed singular as before and
that's what matters. So in conclusion, the constants in
the system don't matter when it comes to determine the system is singular or
non-singular. Now for the rest of this course, singularity and non-singularity
will be the important concept. And completeness, redundancy,
and contradiction will be used much less. So for this reason, you can now start
considering systems of equations where the constants are always 0,
and these are much simpler. Furthermore, the geometric interpretation
of these systems will be pairs of lines that go through the origin.

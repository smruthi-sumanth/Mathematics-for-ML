So, now that you know that the constants
in the system of linear equations are not important in order to determine if
the system is singular or non-singular, you're about to jump into one
of the most important and fundamental objects of linear algebra,
the matrix. Matrices have lots of very
important properties and they arise from many
different places in math. In this case, they will arise from
the coefficients in the systems of equations in a very natural way. Let us go back to the two systems
of equations you previously saw. Recall that systems 2 and 3 collapse into one system when
you turn the constants into zero. Now, since the constants are zero,
you can forget about them. If you take the coefficients of a and
b and now put them in a two by two shaped box,
which is called an array or a matrix. That's the matrix
corresponding to the system. So, the matrix corresponding to the first
system is the one with entries 1 1 1, and 2. Why these numbers? Because the first equation, a+b can be considered the equation 1 times
a plus 1 times b does the 1 and the 1. And equation, a+2b can be
considered the equation 1 times a plus 2 times b does the 1 and the 2. So, in this matrix,
each row corresponds to each equation and each column to the coefficient
of each one of the variables. In this case, a for the left column and
b for the second column. Similarly, the matrix corresponding
to the second system is this one with entries 1 1 2, and 2. So, a matrix simply an array
of numbers inside a rectangle. These ones are simple as they're
in a two by two rectangle. But later in the course,
you're going to see larger matrices. And matrices just like systems of linear
equations can also be singular or non-singular. Since the first system is non-singular
because it has a unique solution, then we say that its corresponding
matrix is non-singular. And since the second system is singular,
as it has infinitely many solutions, we say that its corresponding
matrix is singular. Of course, there are quicker ways to tell
if the matrix is singular or non-singular. We have without having to find the
solutions to its corresponding systems of equations, as you will
see in the next video.

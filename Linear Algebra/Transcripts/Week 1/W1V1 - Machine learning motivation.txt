Welcome to Week 1 of the
linear algebra course. This week you will
learn what a system of linear equations is and some
of its representations. One of them is as a set
of lines in the plane and another one is an array of
numbers called a matrix. Furthermore, you will learn what singular or non-singular
systems are and why is this so important
in linear algebra. Linear algebra has
applications in many fields of science
and technology. Machine learning is
certainly not the exception. In fact, it is not a stretch to say that
linear algebra is the most useful and widespread math field
in machine learning. In this video you will
learn about some of the best applications of linear algebra in
machine learning, starting with the most
popular application that you may know,
the neural network. Undoubtedly one of
the most popular and ubiquitous machine learning
models is a neural network. Neural networks are used for many cutting edge applications
such as image recognition. For example, neural networks can be trained to
take an image such as this one and be
able to tell with very high accuracy if the
image is a face or not. How do neural networks work? Their functioning is the
topic of an entire class. But let me tell you in a
nutshell how they work. Say you have an image
which is the input. The neural network takes
the image pixels as input and performs many
arithmetic operations on these values in order to get a final value which
indicates that the neural network thinks
the image is a face or not. How do we decide
which parameters go into the mathematical
operations to use? The data helps us as we
pick the parameters that make the best predictions
for the existing data. But here's where linear
algebra comes into play. You see these dots
organized in layers? Those are the nodes of the
neural network and they're meant to loosely mimic the
behavior of the brain. It turns out that
these layers can be expressed as rectangular
arrays of numbers, which are also called matrices. Matrices are one
of the fundamental building blocks of
linear algebra. In order to perform
all the vector or matrix operations to go from the image in the left to the prediction on the right, one uses linear
algebra and calculus. Detecting objects
in images has been a long-term challenge
for machine learning that has seen huge advancement
in the recent years. As you can see in this picture, the neural network is
successful in detecting people, traffic lights, cars, trucks, and even small personal
items such as a handbag. Remember, the image pixels are simply values that
serve as an input where the algorithm performs mathematical operations
to determine the output. Aside from image recognition, we can get computers to see
and recognize what's on them. Neural networks have a numerous other cutting-edge applications. As you can see, linear algebra is used all over the place in machine learning and that is a great reason for
you to master it. In the remainder of this course, you will be learning some
very important concepts and techniques in linear
algebra involving matrices, linear equations,
linear transformations, and much more.

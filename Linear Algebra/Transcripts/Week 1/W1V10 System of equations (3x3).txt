Congratulations. You should
be very proud of yourself. You have learned complicated linear algebra concepts such as systems of linear equations,
matrices, and determinants. You've seen them
in 2 by 2 matrix. The general concepts
are very similar, but in order to really
nail them down, follow me along to see them
defined in 3 by 3 matrices. To start, you'll be
solving first system of three equations
with three unknowns and the problem is
a familiar one. You are in a similar
stores before, but now your goal is to find
the prices of three items, an apple a banana and a cherry. You go to the store
three days in a row. On the first day you
bought an apple or banana and a cherry
and pay 10 dollars. On the second day
you bought an apple, 2 bananas and a cheery and
paid 15 dollars and on the third day about
an apple and banana and 2 cherries and
paid 12 dollars. Now the question is, how
much does each fruit cost? The way to solve this is
very similar to the way to solve the previous systems with two equations and two unknowns. The first equation
says that an apple, a banana and a cherry
cost 10 dollars. The second one says that
the same arrangement plus an extra banana cost 15 dollars. Therefore, that extra
banana must cost those extra 5 dollars
and the third one says of the same
arrangement of Day 1 plus an extra cherry cost 12 dollars, therefore, that extra
cherry must cost that extra 2 dollars so
bananas 5 and cherry is 2. We still need to find
the price of the apple. Now look at the first equation, if the banana is 5 and the cherry is 2 and
the three of them costs 10 dollars then the
apple must cost 3 dollars. Our solutions are the price
an apple is 3 dollars, the price of banana is 5, and the price for cherry is 2. The system of equations you just solved is this one over here, system of Equations 1, which has it's equations a
plus b plus c equals 10, a plus 2b plus c equals
15 and a plus b plus 2c equals 12 and the solution
you got was a equals 3, b equals 5, and c equals 2. Now you're ready to
solve more systems. Here are three systems to solve. Remember that just like before, some of them may not
have a solution. Some of them may have an
infinite number of solutions. If that's case, please stated, even if any of the options all ready shows a solution
to the system. Here, the solution, System 2 has infinitely many solutions. Why? Well, you look
at equation 1, it says a plus b plus c
equals 10 and for Equation 2, there's an extra
c and an extra 5, so that's c equals 5, the price for cherry is 5. However, when you go
from Equation 2 to 3, there's also an extra 5 and also an extra c so Equation 3 brings
nothing new to the table. When you replace c equals
5 on the first equation, you get a plus b equals 5
and actually any triplet where the third
number is 5 and the first 2 add to 5 works. All of these are
solutions to that system, that has infinitely
many solutions. Now let's look at System 3. System 3 has no solutions, why? Well, from the first and the second equation, c equals 5. However, from the
second and the third, c equals 3 because from the second equation
to the third one, you bought an extra cherry and you paid an extra 3 dollars, so c equals 5, but c equals 3, that's a contradiction so
System 3 has no solution. What about System 4? Well, System 4 has infinitely
many solutions, why? Because as you can see, the second equation
is 2 times the first one and the third equation is 3 times the first one. The first one is really
the only equation here that matters or equivalently the
second or the third, but only one of them matters. Any three numbers that
add to 10 would work, for example 0, 0, 10 2, 7, 1, 9, 1, 0, any three numbers that
add to 10 are solution, so we have infinitely
many solutions.

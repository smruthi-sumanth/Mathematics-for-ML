When you learned
two-by-two matrices, there was a very
important concept called linear dependence
and independence, which determined if a matrix was singular or non-singular. In short, at two-by-two matrice has linearly dependent rows, if one row is a multiple
of the other one. For larger matrix, the concept of linear
independence and dependence is a
bit more complex, but still very intuitive. Follow along for the details. In order to understand
linear dependence, consider the following example. Take a look at the system with three equations and
three unknowns. The equations are a equals 1, b equals 2, and a
plus b equals 3. Now, notice that c doesn't appear, but
that doesn't matter. Now this system is singular
for the simple reason that the third equation is the
sum of the first two. To see this more in detail, the first equation
can be written as a plus 0b plus 0c, equals one. The second one is 0a
plus b plus 0c equals 2. If we add them, we get a
plus b plus 0c equals 3, which is precisely
the third equation. Now consider the matrix of the coefficients
of the system. That's the matrix obtained
by forgetting the constants. The matrix has entries
100, 010 and 110. In the same way that the sum of the first two equations
is the third one. The sum of the first two rows in the matrix is
equal to the third, because 1 plus 0 is 1, 0 plus 1 is 1 and 0 plus 0 is 0. Therefore, row 3 depends
on rows one and two. Row 3 in the same way as
equation three doesn't bring anything new
to the table is the sum of the first two. We say that the rows
are linearly dependent, because from the
first and the second, you can form the third one. Therefore, this matrix and
the system are singular. Now let's look at another system which you've already
seen that it's singular. The corresponding matrix
is this one over here, 111, 222, 333. Notice that there are
many relations between the equations of the
system. Here's one. The first equation plus the second equation equals
the third equation. In the matrix, Row 1 plus
Row 2 is equal to Row 3. Row 3 depends on Rows 1 and 2, meaning that the rows
are linearly dependent. Now if you look
closely, this system and this matrix have a
lot of our dependencies. For example the second row is twice the first row and the third row is three
times the first row. This is a highly singular system with a lot of dependencies
between the rows. Now in order to
really understand the concept of linear
dependence and independence, let's take a look at
this other system, which you've also
seen is singular. Now this one is a
little more subtle. What are the relation between the equations? Well, here's one. Let's take the first equation and let's add it to
the third equation. What do you get? You get 2a plus 2b
plus 4c is equal to 0. Now that doesn't
look like one of the equations perhaps,
or perhaps, yes, if you take this equation
and divide it by 2, you get a plus b
plus 2c equals 0, which is precisely
the second equation. In other words, the
second equation is the average of the first
and third equation. In the same way, the average between Row 1 and Row 3 of the matrix is Row 2, so Row 2 depends, Rows 1 and 3. Therefore the rows
of this matrix, as well as the equations in the system are
linearly dependent. Now in contrast, take
a look at this system of equations you've
seen before that this system has a unique
solution, so it's non-singular. Now, no matter how much you try, it is impossible to find any linear relations
between these equations. There's no way you can
obtain the third one, are the other two, or the second one or the
first and the third. There's nothing you can do here. The same thing happens
in the matrix. No row can be obtained as a linear combination
of the other two rows. Thus the rows are
linearly independent. This implies that the
matrix is non-singular. Now as you can see, it's not easy to see and to verify that there's
no relations. Don't worry soon I'm
going to show you some methods to be
able to verify this. But for now you're
ready for a quiz. Determining the
following matrices have linearly dependent
or independent rows, and the answers are in
for the first matrix, notice that the first
row times 3 plus the second row times 2 is
equal to the third row, and so the rows are
linearly dependent. This implies that the
matrix is singular. For the second matrix, notice that if you subtract the second row from
the first one, you get the third row. Those rows again
linearly independent, showing that the
matrix is singular. The third matrix
has no relations. Knowing that no matter
how much you try, there's no way to get one
row out of the other two. For example, the first row
has that leftmost one. There's no way you
can obtain that from linear combinations of the second and third
row and so on. This matrix is non-singular because the rows are
linearly independent. Finally, for the fourth matrix, notice that the first row times 2 is equal to the third row. These rows are dependent
and the matrix is singular.

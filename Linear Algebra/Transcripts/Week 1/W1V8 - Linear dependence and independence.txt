In this video, I will show you a way
to tell if a matrix is singular or non singular directly without having to
solve the system of linear equations. But first,
let us look back at systems of sentences, recall that a system of sentences is
singular if the second sentence carries the same information as the first one. Similarly, a system of equation is
singular if the second equation carries the same information as the first one,
this is the concept of linear dependence. Let's look back at the two systems of
linear equations that you've seen so far with this corresponding matrices and let's
focus on the singular system on the right. The reason this system is singular is
because the second equation is a multiple of the first one in particular
is two times the first one. That means if we take the left hand and
the right hand and multiply everything by two in the first
equation, you get the second equation. Now, if you look at
the corresponding matrix, then the second row is
a multiple off the first one. And by that we mean that if you take
every element in the first row and multiply them all by two,
you get the second row. That means that the second row can
be obtained from the first one, so the second row is
dependent of the first one. Notice that you can also say that the
first row is dependent on the second one by taking the second row and
multiplying everything by a half. So in any way either one depends on
the other one or the other one depends on the one, they're both dependent,
so they're linearly dependent. In contrast in the non-singular
system on the left, the second equation is not a multiple
of the first one, or vice versa. There's no constant that I can multiply
the first equation to get the second equation or vice-versa. This is why the system is non singular
each equation tells you something completely different. So in the corresponding matrix
the same thing happens, no row is a multiple of the other one. I cannot take a number and multiply one row entirely by
the number to get the other row. That means the rows
are linearly independent. As you may imagine the same thing happens
with columns and rows and one can define these concepts of linear dependency
between rows and between columns. And they determine the singularity and
non singularity of the matrix.

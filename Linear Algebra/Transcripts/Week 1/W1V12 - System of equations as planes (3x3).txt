When you learn two by two matrices, you
saw the linear equations on two variables can be represented by lines in the plane. Here are the lines representing
the equations a + b = 10 and a + 2 b = 12. In a similar way a linear equations in
three variables is represented by a plane in three dimensional space. At the right, you have three
dimensional space with three axis. The axis a which is the horizontal axis,
the axis b which is vertical and the axis c, which should stem from the
screen and go all the way to your nose. So, how would the plot of for example, the
equation a + b + c = 1 look like in space. Well, let's look at some points
that will belong to this plot. For example the point 1,0,0 belongs to
this plot because 1 + 0 + 0 is equal to 1. That's the point where the a coordinators
1 and the other towards you. The 0,1,0 also belongs to
here because 0 + 1 + 0 = 1. And finally the 0,0,1 also
belongs to this plot. Now, three points define a plane and
actually the entire plane that passes through those three points is the set of
solutions of the equation a + b+ c = 1. So in the same way as a linear equation
with two variables correspond to a line in the plane, a linear equation on 3
variables correspond to a plane in space. Now, in the particular case where
the constant equation is zero for example, in the equation 3a- 5b + 2c = 0, the plane must go through
the origin which is the 0,0,0. And the reason for
this is because if we set a = 0 b = 0 and c = 0,
this is a solution to the equation because the sum of 3(0) + 5(0) + 2(0) = 0. So now in the same way as we used
to intersect lines to get points as the solutions to systems equations, you
can also intersect planes, check this out. So here we're not so concerned about
getting the right visualization because these things are hard to
visualize in two dimensions. However, we're going to be concerned
about how the intersections of these planes appear. So for this system of equations, a + b+ c
= 0, a + 2b + c = 0, and a + b + 2c = 0. Let's look at the first equation, that corresponds to some plane
that goes through a 0,0,0. The second equation corresponds to
some other plane that goes through the 0,0,0 and
these 2 planes intersect at a line. And the third one corresponds to another
plane that passes to the point 0,0,0 and the three planes intersect at a single
point which is precisely the point 0,0,0. So this is important, because this is a
NON-singular system, it has a unique solution. And that unique solution
is the point 0,0,0. Now let's look at system 2,
the first equation is again a plane and the second equation is another plane and
both of them go through the origin and they intersected a line. Now this system is singular, so what happens is that the third
plane also crosses the other 2 and the origin, but it actually
crosses the other two at a line. So these are three planes that all
of them go through the same line. So the set of solutions is not just
a point, it's an entire line, so there are multiple solutions
to the system of equations, which means that the system is singular. And finally we have this other system
where the equations are a + b + c = 0, 2a + 2b + 2c = 0 and 3a + 3b + 3c = 0. The first one corresponds to a plane. Now as you've seen before, the second
equation is just a multiple of the first one, so it's actually the same equation. So it's not surprising that it
corresponds to the exact same plane. And the third equation also
corresponds to the exact same plane. Therefore the set of solutions to the
system is every single point in the plane, there are multiple solutions, and
therefore this system is again singular

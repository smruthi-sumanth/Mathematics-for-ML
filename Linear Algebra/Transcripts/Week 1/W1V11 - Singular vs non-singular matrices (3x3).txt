In the previous video, you solve four systems of three
equations and three unknowns. You find that the first
one has a unique solution, the second one has
infinitely many solutions, the third one has no solutions, and the fourth one has
infinitely many solutions. Using the same
terminology as if four, the first one is complete, the second one is redundant, the third one is contradictory, and the fourth one is redundant. The first one is non-singular, while the other three
are all singular. Now, just like with systems of two equations
and two unknowns, an easy way to find if a system is singular
or non-singular is to turn the constants into zeros
and to study that system. Now, that you have simplified the system with zeros
as the constants, then let's look
at the solutions. The first system,
we know that it has a unique solution
since it is non-singular. And furthermore, 0, 0, 0 is a solution
because setting A, B, and C equal to zero is
a solution to the system. Therefore, the solution
is the point 0, 0, 0 and this system is
complete and non-singular. Now, notice that
systems 2 and 3 are now the same system because we said this constants to be zero. What are the solutions
to the system? Well, take a look
equations 1 and 2. The only difference
between equations 1 and 2 is that equation
2 has an extra C. C must be equal to
zero because that C doesn't change the
result which is zero. Therefore, c is equal to zero. If you plug that into
the first equation, you get that A plus B
must equal to zero. So A is equal to minus B. All the points satisfy them. The first coordinate
is equal to negative, the second coordinate, and
the third one has to be zero. This system is
redundant and singular. The fourth system, well, it's solutions are
all the points for which the three
coordinates at zero. That means A can be anything, B can be anything, and C needs to be minus A minus B for the three
to add to zero. The system is redundant
and singular. Just like for each
of the systems associated with a matrix that keeps track of its coefficients. Again, in each row you have each equation and each column you have the coefficients
of each of the variables A, B, and C. The matrices
are these ones. Using the same
notation as before, these matrices are singular or non-singular based on if the systems are singular
or non-singular.

As I mentioned before,
equations behave a lot like sentences, as they are statements
that give you information. In this video, you will learn
what a linear equation is, and what a system of linear equations is. As a matter of fact you will be solving
your first system of linear equations. Which is extracting all the possible
information from that system. Just like with systems of sentences,
systems of linear equations can also be singular or non-singular based
on how much information they carry. And as you already learned these
concepts of real life sentences, you are more than ready to
tackle them with equations. In the previous video, you saw sentences
such as between the dog and the cat, one is black. For the rest of the course, you'll focus on sentences that carry
numerical information such as this one. The price of an apple and a banana is $10. This sentence can easily be
turned into equations as follows. If a is the price of an apple,
and b is the price of a banana, then the equation stemming from
the sentence is a + b = 10. Now, here's the first quiz in which you
will be solving the first system of linear equations in this class. The problem is the following,
you are going to a grocery store, but this is a very peculiar grocery store. In this store, the individual items don't
have information about their prices. You only get the information about the
total price when you pay in the register. Naturally, being a math person as you are, you're interested in figuring
out the price of each item. So you keep track of the total prices
of different combinations of items in order to deduce the individual prices. So the first day that you go to the store
you bought an apple and a banana and they cost $10. The second day you bought an apple and
two bananas and they cost $12. And the question is,
how much does each fruit cost? So several things may happen, you may be able to figure out
the price of the apple and banana. Or you may conclude that you don't have
enough information to figure this out. Or even more, you may conclude that there
was a mistake with the prices giving this information,
all of these are options in the quiz. And the solution is that apple's cost
$8 and bananas cost $2 each, why? Well, from day 1 you can see that
an apple plus a banana is $10, from day 2, you can see that
an apple plus two bananas is $12. So what was the difference
between day 1 and day 2? Well in day 2 you bought
one more banana than day 1. Also in day 2 you pay
$2 more than in day 1. Thus you can safely conclude that that
extra banana you bought on day 2 cost $2. The extra $2 you paid on day 2 were
because of that extra banana you bought on day 2. And now that you know that bananas cost 2,
well how much do apples cost? Well from day 1, you can see that
an apple and a banana cost $10. So if a banana cost $2 then the remaining
$8 must correspond to the apple. Thus, each apple costs $8 and
each banana costs $2. Now here's quiz 2, the scenario is
the same except the prices in the store are a little different, and you also
bought different quantities of fruits. On day 1, you bought an apple and
a banana and they cost $10. On day 2 you bought two apples and
two bananas and they cost $20. The question is how much
does each fruit cost? Remember that the options of not
having enough information or having a mistake in the information
given are both valid as well. For this problem, the solution is that
there is not enough information to tell the actual prices, and why is this? Well you can use a similar
reasoning than before. From day 1, you can deduce that an apple
and a banana cost $10 from day 2, you can deduce that two apples and
two bananas cost $20. But these two equations
are the same thing. They may not look the same, but
in disguise, they're the exact same thing. Because you see if one apple and
one banana cost $10, then twice of one apple and one banana
cost twice of $10, which is $20. So two apples and two bananas cost $20. Therefore the system is redundant because
it basically has the same equation twice. It's like that system of sentences
where both sentences stated that the dog was black, the system
didn't carry enough information. Now what are the solutions to the system? Well, because the system doesn't
carry enough information, the system has infinitely many solutions. Any two numbers that had to add to
ten are a solution to the system. So for example if the apple's 8 and the
banana's 2, then that works because apple plus bananas, 10 and
two apples plus two bananas is 20. But if they're 5 and 5 that also works. If they're 8.3 and 1.7 that also works. And even then saying that the apples are
free and the bananas are 10, works too. So this system has infinitely many
solutions because you simply don't have enough information. You don't have the two equations to narrow
it down to one single solution like you had with the complete system. And now, you're ready for a final quiz. Similar scenario except the first day
you bought an apple and banana and they cost $10 and the second day you bought two
apples and two bananas and they cost $24. Can you figure out how
much each fruit costs? And remember there's still the options
of not enough information or a mistake in the information. And the answer here is that
there's no solution, why? Well in the same fashion as before,
if one apple and one banana cost $10, then two apples and
two bananas must cost $20. But the store charged you $24 for
two apples and two bananas where are those
four extra dollars? If you assume that there are no extra
fees for buying more than one fruit or discounts or anything of that sort. Then you must conclude that that extra
money must be due to a mistake with the register when you checked out
in at least one of the two days. This means that these two equations
contradict each other, just like the two sentences, the dog is black and
the dog is white contradicted themselves. And this concludes that
the system has no solutions. So here's our recap,
in the previous three quizzes, you solved three systems of equations. The first one has the equations
a + b = 10 and a + 2b =12. Because the price of an apple and
banana was 10, and the price of apple and two bananas were 12. The second one has the equations
a + b = 10 and 2a + 2b = 20. And the third one has the equations
a + b = 10 and 2a + 2b = 24. The first one had a unique solution
which was a = 8 and b = 2. For a is the price of an apple and
b the price of banana. The reason this system has a unique
solution is because both equations give you one different piece of information. Thus you're able to narrow down
the solution to one unique solution. For this reason the system is complete and
non-singular. The second system,
has infinitely many solutions, which are any two numbers that add to 10. In this system,
the two equations are the exact same one. So you never had a second equation to
help you narrow down the solution to a unique one. This means the system is redundant and
singular. And finally, the third system has no solution because
the two equations contradict each other. Therefore, the system of equations
is contradictory and singular. So as you see, we're using the same
terminology as with systems of sentences and
everything works in the exact same way. And finally, some clarification, you may
have noticed the words linear equation several times, what does that mean? Well linear equation can be anything
like a + b = 10, 2a + 3b = 15, 3.4a- 48.99b +2c = 122.5,
anything like that. And notice that it can have
as many variables as we want. But there's a special rule that must be
followed, in a linear equation, variables a, b, c etc were only allowed to have
numbers or scalar is attached to them. And there's also an extra number all by
itself like the 122.5 here allowed to be in the equation. So in short, you can multiply
the variable by scalars and then add them or subtract them and
then add a constant and that's it. So what's an equation that's non-linear? Well, non-linear equations
can be much more complicated. They can have squares
like a squared b squared. They can have things like sine,
cosine, tangent arctan, anything like that powers like b to the 5. They can have powers like 2 to the a or
3 to the b. And furthermore,
you can actually multiply the a's and b's. In linear questions you can only add them,
but in a non-linear equation you can have ab
squared, b divided by a, 3 divided by b, things like logarithms,
anything along those lines. So linear algebra is the study of linear
equations like the ones in the left. And since they're much simpler then there
are many things you can do with them, such as manipulating them and
extracting information out of them. So we're only going to worry about
the linear equations in the left. And the reason it's called linear algebra
its because it's the study of linear equations.

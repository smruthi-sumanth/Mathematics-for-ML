Now that you know how to
find the solutions to linear equations by
manipulating them, you pretty much know what
matrix row reduction is. Matrix row reduction, also called the Gaussian elimination, consists of applying the
exact same manipulations except to the rows of a matrix. In order to turn
that matrix into a much more simplified form, from which you can
extract lots of useful information.
Let me show you how. We call them when
you want to solve a system of linear equations, say the one with equations, 5a plus b equals 17 and
4a minus 3b equals 6. You first went through an
intermediate step of removing the variable a from
the bottom equation in order to calculate
the value of b. Then you went through a step of replacing the value of b in the first equation in order
to get the value of a. The solved system has equation
a equals 3 and b equals 2. Now, what happens if you follow the same procedure but in
the matrix of coefficients? Here's the matrix corresponding to the original system
and recall that we can forget about the
constant 17 and six and only pick up
the coefficients 5, 1, 4, and minus 3 and here is the matrix corresponding to
the intermediate system. Now you'll see this
more in detail later, but for now bear with me. From the original matrix, you can get the matrix in the intermediate system by applying some row manipulations. An important feature
of this matrix is that it has ones in the main diagonal and zeros
underneath the diagonal. This form of matrix is called row echelon form and finally, some more manipulation will
get you to the matrix with ones in the diagonal
and zeros everywhere. Why is it the matrix corresponding
to the system above? Because you can see the
system of equations a equals 3 and b equals 2 as a
system of equations, 1a plus 0b equals 3 and
0a plus 1b equals 2, from which this matrix
with entries 1, 0, 0, and 1 stems. The first matrix, the
one in the middle, is called a row echelon
form and this one over here is called the
reduced row echelon form. This one will be introduced
more later, but for now, let's focus on the row
echelon form one as it gives us a lot of useful
information of the matrix. Now what happens if you
have a singular system of equations such as the one
you've seen in the beginning. As you've seen before,
this system can be manipulated and turned into
this system over here, where the first
equation is the same, but the second one is
an obvious 0 equals 0. Thus the original matrix can be manipulated and turned into
the matrix with entries 1, 1, 0, and 0. This is also a row echelon form. Here's another example from
the quiz on the last video. In this system, you
have the equations, 5a plus b equals 11 and
10a plus 2b equals 22. Notice that subtracting twice the first equation
from the second one, you get the trivial equation, 0 equals 0, indicating that
the system is singular. In the matrix we've
gone from this one over here with entries 5, 1, 10, and 2 to this one
with entries 1, 0.20 and 0, and that one is the
row echelon form. Finally, let's look at this
very singular system of equation 0 equals
0 and 0 equals 0. The system can not be
manipulated any further, so the row echelon form of this matrix is actually itself. The general way that a matrix in row echelon form looks
like is the following. On the main diagonal, we have a bunch of ones followed by perhaps a bunch of zeros. You could potentially
have all ones, but you could also
have all zeros. Below the diagonal,
everything is a zero, to the right of the ones any number is allowed and finally to the
right of the zeros, everything must be zero. Following these rules in the
case of 2 by 2 matrices, only three things may happen. You have 2, 1s in the diagonal. You have 1, 1 in the diagonal or you have 0, 1s
in the diagonal. These are the ones you've
seen earlier in the video.

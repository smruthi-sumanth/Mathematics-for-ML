Now that you learn how to solve systems
of two equations with two variables, let me show you how to solve systems of
three equations with three variables. It's actually very similar. The goal here is first
to leave a by itself. So we're going to make sure that
the only equation that contains an a is the first one and that there's no
a on the 2nd and 3rd equations. So the way to do this is to
normalize the first column, namely divide each row by
the coefficient of a to make sure that every equation has a coefficient of 1 for
the variable a. And now use the first equation to remove
the variable a from all the other ones. So subtract the first
equation from the second and then from the third to get the following. Now in the resulting system you
have successfully isolated a, and what remains is a system of two equations
with two unknowns that are b and c. And you know exactly how
to solve these ones. So when you solve it you
get the values for b and c. Let me show you how, so now let's
forget about the first equation and solve the 2nd and 3rd and
you know how to do this. First, divide these two rows
by the coefficient of b to get this where the leading
coefficient of b is now 1. Now use this equation, the second
one to remove b from the third one. So subtract the second equation
from the third one to get this, 11 minus 11/6, c equals minus 11/2. In this way you have isolated
b in the bottom two rows. From here, you can divide by minus
11/6 to get that c is equal to 3. So now let's go back to the beginning and
now we know that c is equal to 3. Then we can go propagate upstairs. So replace c equals 3 in the second
equation to get b equals 2. And now that you know b and
c replace b equals 2, and c equals 3 in the first
equation to get a equals 4. So the final solution is a equals 4,
b equals 2, and c equals 3.

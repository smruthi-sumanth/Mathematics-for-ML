You are now ready to learn
something that has been lurking yet present in
the previous lessons. In one of the first quizzes, you took a system of linear
equations and found solution. In general, this
is hard to do by simply looking at the equations. However, there exists a
simple way to do this. In this video, you will learn a method or an algorithm
that helps you find the solution to a system of
linear equations and that is also able to tell
you if the system is singular or non-singular. First, let's go back to how you solve the first
system of equations. The one with equations
a plus b equals 10, and a plus 2b equals 12. Recall that the scenario was that an apple and a banana cost 10 and an apple and
two bananas cost 12. You figured out that since the second day you
bought an extra banana, paid two more, then the
extra banana must cost two. From this, and the fact
that they both cost 10, you concluded that the
apple must cost eight. Thus you went from
the original system of equations to a solved system. One that is still a system
of equations except that the equations are a
equals 8 and b equals 2. The solved system is much
simpler because each equation actually tells us the value
of each of the variables. The goal is to take every system and turn it
into a solved system. That is, if the system is non-singular and has
exactly one solution. Now in order to get from the
system to the solve system, you followed some process. This processes required
manipulating the equations. Without noticing what you actually did in your head was to follow a specific process
that involves manipulating, such as swapping equations, adding them, multiplying
them by constants. In this video, you'll see what
this means more in detail. The first step in
order to go from a system to a solved
system is the following. Notice that in the
system in the left, the equations both
have a and b on them. You'd like to get to one
in which the a and the b are isolated and they only
appear in one equation each. The first step
will be to look at the second equation and try to eliminate the
variable a from it. But before you do that,
it's important to know how one can
manipulate equations. That is, take some linear
equations and produce some other ones that are still true based on the original ones. One way to manipulate
equations is to multiply them by a constant. For example, if an apple
and a banana cost $10, how much would seven apples
and seven bananas cost? Well, the answer is $70, as this is 7 times 10. Equation a plus b equals 10
can be multiplied by 7 on both sides to get the equation
7a plus 7b equals 70. These equations carry the
exact same information. Thus, the first one is
true so is the second. Another way to
manipulate equations is to add two equations. For example, if an apple and a banana
cost $10 and two apples and three bananas cost $26, then how much are three
apples and four bananas? Well, if you add
these two equations, you get the 3 apples plus
4 bananas is equal to 36. If the two first
equations are true, and so is there sum. Now I'll show you how to solve a harder system of equation in order for you to see how
these manipulations are used. Here's a system of equations
that you'll learn to solve. The equations are
5a plus b equals 17 and 4a minus 3b equals 6, and recall that
your first goal in order to get to a
solved system is to try to eliminate
the variable a from the second equation in
order to leave b by itself. The first step is not
always necessary, but it will make
your life easier. The step is to divide each
equation by the coefficient of a in order for both of them to have a coefficient
of one beside the a. If we do this, then
new equations are a plus 0.2b equals 3.4, and a minus 0.75b equals 1.5. As you saw before, these are equivalent to the first
two because all we did was multiply the entire equation left and right by a constant. Now in order to remove a
from the second equation, one way is to subtract the first equation
from the second one. Like this; we take
the second equation, we subtract the first one, and we can do this
component-wise, a minus a is 0a, minus 0.75b minus 0.2b is minus 0.95b and 1.5 minus
3.4 is minus 1.9. The resulting equation is minus 0.95b is equal to minus 1.9. Now we can divide
by minus 0.95 at both sides to get
that b is equal to 2. You have succeeded. You have found the value of b. In other words, you removed
a from the first equation to get b equals 2 in
your solved system. Now that you know
that b equals 2, you can simply plug that
into the first equation. The first equation says
a plus 0.2b is 3.4, so a plus 0.2 times
2 is equal to 3.40. 0.2 times 2 is 0.4, so we have a plus 0.4 equals 3.4 and subtracting
0.4 from both sides, you get that a is equal to 3, and that is the value
of the second variable. In a nutshell, that
is how you solve a system of two equations
and two variables. Now here's a small caveat. Imagine that you are solving this new system with equations 5a plus b equals 17
and 3b equals 6, and you'd like to eliminate
a from this equation. The first step is to divide
both by the coefficient of a. For the first equation, this
goes exactly as before. However, for the
second equation, the coefficient of a is zero and you can't divide by zero. Are we doomed? Well, actually the doom
turns into good luck. Check it out. The equation
says 3b equals 6. It already has a
eliminated from it and actually implies
that b is equal to 2 if you divide by
3 on both sides. This is the value of b already, and the second equation is
already solved in the system. In order to solve the first one, you proceed to do
the same thing, replace on the first
equation that b equals 2, get that a is equal to three, and bring it back as a solution. You're now ready for a quiz. Solve the following
system of equations, 2a plus 5b equals 46 and
8a plus b equals 32. The solution to the system is
a equals 3 and b equals 8. I invite you to verify that those values actually
work for the equations.

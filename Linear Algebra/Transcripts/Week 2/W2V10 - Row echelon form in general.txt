Now that you've seen
row echelon form for two-by-two matrices. Let me show you what it
is for bigger matrices. Recall this system of equations and recall that the
process you took to solve it was this
intermediate step over here, where the first equation
has variables a, b, and c, the second one only
has variable b and c, and the third one
only has variable c. The exact same
row operations can be done in the matrix
corresponding to the system in order to get
the matrix on the right, which now has ones in the diagonal and zeros
underneath the diagonal. This is the row echelon
form of the matrix. Now, this is the way a
row echelon form matrix looks like in general, here are two different examples. In here, the stars
represent numbers that could be zero or
non-zero, it doesn't matter. The matrix may or may not
have rows full of zeros. However, if it does, they need to go at the bottom. Furthermore, notice
that every row that is non-zero has a leftmost
non-zero entry. These are called the pivots. Every row has a particular pivot and there's a rule about
pivots which said that every pivot has
to be strictly to the right of the pivots
of the row above. In other words, if you stand at a pivot and you look at
all the pivots above, they all need to be
strictly to its left. Now the row echelon
form, as you saw before, is very useful to tell
you the rank of a matrix. It's actually the
number of pivots. The matrix on the
left has Rank 5 and the matrix on the
right has Rank 3. Now here's a very
important note in terms of notation that we're
going to use in this class. On the left, you see a
row echelon form matrix. Now you could do some cosmetics and divide the
first row by three, the second one by one, or they mean the same, and
the third one by minus four to get a matrix
that looks like this. Obviously the stars are
now different values, but the important thing is that the pivots are now one and
they're in the same location because dividing by
a number one turn a zero into a non-zero or
a non-zero into a zero. In most textbooks, the form
is the one on the left. In general, pivots different
than one are allowed. However, for this class, we're going to use
the form in the right. We're going to take that
extra step of dividing by the leading entry in the pivot in order to get
the pivots to be one. This makes no mathematical
difference in terms of rank. It's the same rank and it's more consistent
with the way we are solving our system of equations by dividing by
the leading coefficient. But this is definitely
something to keep in mind. Here are some other examples of row echelon forms of matrices. The matrix over here
that you've seen before can be reduced to this one by simply subtracting the first row from the
second row and third row. Notice that the one on the
right is in row echelon form. Now what if the
matrix is singular? Let's try to find the
row echelon form of this singular matrix over here,
which you've seen before. First subtract the
first row from the second and third ones to
get this matrix over here. Now take the second row, multiply it by two, and subtract it
from the third one. You get this matrix over here. That is the row echelon
form of that matrix. Now let's find the
row echelon form for another singular matrix
that you've seen before. For this matrix, what you can
do is take the first row, multiply it by two, and subtract it from the
second row to get this matrix. Now, you can again take the first row and multiply
it by three and subtract it from this third row
to get this one over here. Now check this out. Just like for
two-by-two matrices, the rank of the
matrix is the number of pivot ones in the
row echelon form. Here we have the
row echelon forms that we've just calculated. If you look at the pivot ones, there's three here, because
the matrix has Rank 3, two here, because the matrix has Rank 2 and 1 here and zero here. That's exactly the ranks of
the corresponding matrices.

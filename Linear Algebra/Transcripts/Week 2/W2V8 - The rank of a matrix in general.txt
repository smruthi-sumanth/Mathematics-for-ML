Now, just as it happened
with two by two matrices, the rank is a measure of how non
singular three by three matrices. And its geometric meaning is very
similar to that for two by two matrices. Follow along with me and I'll show you
how the rank works for larger matrices. So in order to define the rank of a three
by three matrix and look at the system of three equations and three unknowns
that you've been looking at so far. And let's focus on what equations
bring new information to the table. And by not bringing any information to
the table, I mean an equation that is already a linear combination of
the other equations in the system. So in system 1 you can check out all
the equations are linearly independent, there's no way to obtain
one out of the other two. Therefore the system
has three equations and all of them are new pieces of information,
so it has three pieces of information. The number of independent
equations is the rank, so this system has rank 3 and by convention
we say that the matrix has rank 3. Now let's take a look at system 2, and this can be done in different ways,
but one way to look at it is to realize that the second equation is the average
of the first and the third. So you can think of the first and the
third to be the new pieces of information, and the second one doesn't bring
anything new to the table. And if you do this in a different order,
you can get different things, but you will always get that there's 3
equations and 2 pieces of information. Because the system has rank 2 and
thus the matrix is defined to have rank 2. System 3 is simpler since
the first equation is new, but the second one is twice the first one. So it depends on it and the third one
is also three times the first one, so it depends on the first one as well. And so we have three equations and
one piece of information, the system therefore has rank 1 and
so does the matrix. And as usual system 4 is the simplest one,
no equation brings anything new to the table because no equation tells
you anything about a, b and c. So you have 3 equations, 0 piece of
information and the matrix has rank 0. There is a question, it seems that
calculating the rank is not that easy. So is there a simpler way
to calculate the rank? And the answer is yes, and it has to do
with the row echelon form for matrix.

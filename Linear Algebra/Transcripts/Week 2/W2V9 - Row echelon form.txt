In the previous videos, you learn one particular form of a matrix called
row echelon form. This gives you lots
of information about the matrix and it can be obtained with simple
row operations. In this video, you will
see this more in detail. Recall from previous videos
that the row echelon forms of these three matrices are
the ones in the right. However, previously, we used the systems of
equations to find them. Now you can simply use the row
operations you've learned. Follow me along to
see how to do this. In order to calculate
the row echelon form for this matrix with entries 5, 1, 4 and minus 3, here's
what you would do. The idea is to get rid of
that four in the bottom left. First divide each row by the leftmost
non-zero coefficient to get the matrix
with entries 1, 0.2, 1 and minus 0.75. Now, in order to remove
that bottom-left one, keep the first row the same, but subtract the first row
from the second row to obtain the row with entries
zero and minus 0.95. We have succeeded at
getting a zero in the bottom left corner,
which is what we wanted. Now as a final step, divide the second row by the leftmost
non-zero coefficient in order to get a one on
the bottom right corner. Now the matrix is in
row echelon form. What if you do this
for a singular matrix? Well, if you try it for
this matrix with entries 5, 1, 10, and 2, let's
see what happens. The first step is
to divide each row by the leftmost coefficients, so you get the matrix
with entries 1, 0.2, 1, and 0.2. Now in order to disappear
that bottom left one, what you can do is
take the bottom row, subtract the top row, and what you get is 0, 0. Now that's the new bottom row. Now let's see what happens
when you try to divide the second row by the leftmost
non-zero coefficient. Well, that's impossible because you'd be dividing 0 by
0, which is undefined. That's no problem.
What you do is you let this one be the row
echelon form instead. Finally, for the very singular
matrix entries 0, 0, 0, there's not a lot you can
do because you cannot divide each row by the leftmost coefficients,
those are zero. Instead, you just say this
is the row echelon form. In summary, here
are the matrices and here are the
row echelon forms. Here is a very interesting
connection with rank. Look at the first one. It has two ones in the diagonal, and it happen to have Rank 2. The next one has 1,
1 in the diagonal, and it happen to have Rank 1. The third one has zero ones in the diagonal and it
happen to have Rank 0. That's actually the connection. The rank of a matrix
is the number of ones in the diagonal
of the row echelon form. That's an easy way to
calculate the rank. Notice furthermore, that the
first one is non-singular, the second one is singular and
the third one is singular. A matrix is NON-singular
if and only if the row echelon form has
only ones and no zeros.

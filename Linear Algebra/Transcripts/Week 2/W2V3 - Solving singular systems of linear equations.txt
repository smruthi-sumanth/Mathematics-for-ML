Now this method is actually
more powerful than you think. In the previous examples,
you saw it in action for a non-singular system that
has a unique solution. But what happens with a singular
system namely one that does not have a unique solution. Let us solve the singular system that also
came up before the system of equations a + b = 10 and 2a + 2b = 20. Recall that the system was redundant since
the second equation is equivalent to the first one. So let's try the same steps as before
to try to eliminate a from the second equation and see where that takes us. The first step is to divide both
equations by the coefficient of a getting the two equations a + b = 10 and
a + b =10. Notice that they're the same. The next step is to remove a from
the second equation by subtracting the equation a + b = 10 from
the equation a + b = 10. Now what do you get here? Well, you get 0 = 0 because you're
subtracting the entire string from itself. This equation 0 = 0 is trivially true and unfortunately gives you zero
information about what b can be. What happened? Well, in your efforts of removing a from
the second equation or to leave b alone, you also remove b. And there is nothing you can do to get b. There's no manipulation you can do
to remove only one of the variables because anything you do to remove
one will also remove the other one because the system is singular. And again, this is because the second
equation adds no value to the system. So in other words, the solved system
is this one where a + b = 10 and there's no other equation to
give us more information. So can you still get the solution
to look like a equals something and b equals something else? Well you still can pick any number x and
let a equals be x. How much is b then? Well if a + b = 10, then b must be 10- x. This is a solution to the system. It's not a unique solution
because x can be any value. So the solve system has one degree of
freedom and if you vary this degree of freedom x, you can get many
different solutions to the system. The solutions for
example form a line as you said before. Now, what happens if you use the same
method with a singular system that is contradictory? Recall that the contradictory
system that you saw earlier was this one a + b = 10 and
2a + 2b = 24. And let's use the same steps to solve it. First we want to eliminate
a from this equation. So we divide both equations
by the coefficient of a. We subtract equation 1 from equation 2 and we get that 0 n the left
is equal to 2 on the right. 0 is never equal to 2 so
that's a contradiction. Therefore there are no
solutions to the system. So now you're ready for a quiz. The quiz is the following. Can you solve the following system of
equations 5a + b = 11 and 10a + 2b = 22. So if you look closely into
the two equations in the system, you will find that equation
2is equation 1 times two. Or equivalent if you take equation 2 and
divide it by 2, you obtain equation 1. Therefore the system is singular and
it has infinitely many solutions.

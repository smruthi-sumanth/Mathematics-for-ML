Throughout the last few videos, there
has been a concept that you've seen yet still have not been
formally introduced to. It is the notion of the rank
of a matrix which in some way measures how much
information that matrix or its corresponding system
linear equations is carrying. Follow along with me and
see how to define and calculate the rank. One great application of ranking machine
learning is an image compression. Take a look at this image,
it's very crisp, but it also uses a lot of storage because every pixel intensity
has to be stored as a number. Could you store this image or perhaps a slightly blurrier version
of it using significantly less space. The answer is yes. And this is the main topic of this
video which is the rank of a matrix. It turns out that pixelated images are
matrices and the rank of matrix is related to the amount of space that is needed
to store that corresponding image. This particular image has ranked 200,
which is quite high. There's a very powerful technique
on singular value decomposition or SVD in short, which can reduce the rank of a matrix
while changing it as little as possible. You can see as video applied
here to reduce a heavy image of ranked 200 into images of rank 1,
2, 5, 15 and 50. Notice how the images of rank 15 and
50 are very similar to the original and we take a lot less space to store. So recall that in systems of sentences, there was a notion of how much
information the system carried. Let's look at three systems of sentences. System 1, with sentences,
the dog is black and the cat is orange. System 2 with sentences,
the dog is black and the dog is black. And system 3 with sentences the dog and
the dog notice that system 1 has two sentences and
it carries two pieces of information. System 2 also has two sentences,
but they're the same. So this system carries only one piece of
information and system 3, well, it has two sentences, but it carries no information
regarding the color of the animals. So it carries zero pieces of information, recall that your goal is
to determine the color. So the amount of information a system of
sentences carries is defined as the rank of the system. The system 1 has ranked 2, system 2 has
ranked 1 and system 3 has ranked 0. Next you'll see how this
notion applies to matrices and this corresponding systems
of linear equations. Now, let's go back to the three systems
of equations from the previous videos. As you've already seen,
the first system has two equations and each equation brings
something new to the table. Some new piece of information. That's why you're able to narrow
down the solutions to one point. The first equation narrows down to a line
and the second one narrows them down to a point that the system has
two pieces of information. This is how the rank of
the system is defined. So the rank is 2,
the second system has two equations, but recall that the second equation
was the same as the first one. Therefore the system really only
carries one piece of information which is the first equation. This is why you're able to narrow
down the set of solutions to a line, but that's as far as you can get. Thus, the rank of the system
is defined as one, and finally the third system
has two equations. But they carry no information as any
number a and b satisfy these equations. Does the system carries zero
pieces of information and its rank is defined to be 0. And now on to define the rank of matrix, since its system of information has
a corresponding matrix and the rank of the matrix is defined as the rank of
the corresponding system of equations. Thus the matrix corresponding to
the first system has ranked 2. The one corresponding to the second
system has ranked 1, and the one corresponding to
the third system has ranked 0. Now there's a special relationship
between the rank of a matrix and its solution space. Recall that the solution space for
each of these matrices is the set of solutions to the system of equations
when the constants are zero. So for the first one recall that
the solutions are only a=0 and b=0. So that's a point and the dimensional solution space is 0
because the dimension of a point is 0. For the second one, the set of solutions
was some line and a line has dimension 1. So the dimension of
the solution space was 1. And for the third one, well every a and b works here because any point a and
b is a solution to that system. Therefore the solution space is
a plane and it has dimension 2. So what happens here in all three
cases is that the rank is equal to 2. The number of rows in the matrix minus
the dimension of the solution space. This is always the case for 2 by 2 matrix. And in general, as you'll see later,
this rank and solution space always and then dimensional solution always add
to the number of rows in the matrix. Notice also the first
matrix is non-singular and the other two are singular. So a matrix is non-singular if and
only if it has full rank, namely if the rank is equal
to the number of rows. This is the same as saying that a system
of equations is non-singular if it carries as many pieces of
information as equations it has, meaning that you carry the maximum
amount of information possible. Thus that this equation brings a new
piece of information to the table and there's no redundancy between equations. And now you're ready for a quiz for
this quiz, please determine the rank of the same two matrices you've seen
recently and the solutions are in. So since the first one has a solution
space of dimension 0, the rank is 2, and the second one has a solution space
of dimension 1, so the rank is 1. Notice that the first
matrix is non-singular and the second one is singular.

Welcome to week 2. Well, you'll learn how to solve
systems of linear equations and how to manipulate matrix
to vastly simplify them. But first,
let me begin with some applications. Last week, you saw very interesting
application of linear argument to machine learning that of neural networks for
image recognition. This week I'll turn your attention
into sound recognition and some very unique applications for
social good. As you saw in week 1, and neural network
can be trained to taken images and input and determine the high accuracy
if the image was a face or not. This week you'll see the neural networks
can be trained to take other inputs, such as sound. A neural network can transcribe the sounds
that a person is speaking with high accuracy. And also determining if
they form a question or a statement as well as the, [INAUDIBLE]
>> While the applications of machine learning for social good has
been in the area of wildlife and bio habitat preservation. One such example is acoustic monitoring, which tracks species through their sounds
and acoustic data for the environment. It's an amazing use of sound recognition
that can save in dangerous species and provide crucial information for researchers to map environmental
changes through a large sound data. An additional fun application has recently
been automatic music generation where music data is compressed
into discrete codes. And through a special neural network
called a variation of autoencoder. It's trained on specific genres of
music and is able to produce new music. As you can see the possibilities for one
can build two neural networks are endless. And the great thing is
that they're very core. They're all very similar. All you need to do is train a neural
network to understand the data has been given and to replicate it. So if you get images will produce images. If you give music text video,
it will produce exactly that. And as you've seen, mineral device at
the very core of how neural networks work.

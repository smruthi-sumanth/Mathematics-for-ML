Before we get into the whole
row reduction process, it is important to note that the same manipulations
that you use to solve systems of
linear equations can be used in matrices. These are called row
operations in a matrix and a very important
property that they have is that they preserve the
singularity of a matrix. In other words, if you apply
them to a singular matrix, you get a singular
matrix and if you apply them to a
non-singular matrix, you get a non-singular matrix. In this video, you will learn more about
these row operations. Consider the matrix
with entries 5, 1, 4, and 3. First, check this
matrix is singular or non-singular by calculating
the determinant. The determinant is 5 times 3 minus 1 times 4, which is 11. Therefore, the matrix
is non-singular. Now the first-row operation that you learn is
switching rows. If you switch the
positions of the two rows, you get the matrix
with entries 4, 3, 5, and 1. I promise you that's in
the original matrix, non-singular, then this
one is also non-singular. How do I know this? Well, let's calculate the determinant. The determinant is 4
times 1 minus 3 times 5, which is minus 11, which is different than
zero. It's non-singular. In fact, the determinant
of the matrix obtained after switching
rows like this, it's always a negative of
the original determinant. The reason for this
is that the diagonals change place so the
one you're adding, you're now subtracting, and the one-year or subtracting
now you're adding. Now instead of
getting 15 minus 4, you get 4 minus 15, hence the minus 11. You can imagine that if
the original determinant was a zero, then the resulting one
would also be a zero, which means that if you apply
this to a singular matrix, you've got a singular matrix. Unlike wise, if the original
determinant was not zero, then the resulting
was also not zero. Row switching
preserves singularity or non-singularity of a matrix. The next operation is multiplying a row by
a non-zero scalar. Let's use the same matrix
with determinant 11. Now, let's modify the first row. We're going to leave
this second row by itself and the first row, we're going to multiply
it by a number, say 10, to get 50,10. Now that's going to
be the new first row. What's the determinant of
the new modified matrix 50, 10, 4, 3? It's this and notice, that it is 10 times 11, 10 times the determinant
of the original matrix. Because in each
of the diagonals, you have taken
exactly one element, the one on the top row, and multiplied it by 10 so the whole thing gets
multiplied by 10. Now notice that the scalar
has to be non-zero. In the scalar that
10 is non-zero, then this operation turns a
non-zero determinant into non-zero determinant
and a zero determinant into a zero determinant. Thus, this operation also preserves singularity
and non-singularity. The final operation is to take a row and add it to another row, for example, let's
take the sum of the first and the second row, and that is 9, 4, so 9, 4 is going to be the top one
of the rows in the matrix, and the bottom one is
going to be the same. This new determinant is 9
times 3 minus 4 times 4, which is actually 11. Believe it or not,
when you do this, you get the same determinant
as the beginning. Proving this is slightly
harder and you can find it in a written tandem in the
resources of the class. But the most important
part is that since the determinant stays the
same after this operation, then this operation
also preserves singularity and non-singularity
just like the other ones.

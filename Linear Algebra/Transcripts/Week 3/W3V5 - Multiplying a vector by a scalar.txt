Another very useful and simple operation you can do on
vectors is multiply them by a scalar. For example, if the vector is (1,2) and
you'd like to multiply by the scalar, lambda =3, then the result
is the element-wise product. That means you multiply each of
the elements of the vector by 3 to obtain the vector (3,6). Graphically, it means you stretch
the vector (1,2) by a factor of 3. What if the scalar is negative? No problem, what happens here is that the
vector gets again stretched by the factor but also reflected about the origin. So for example, if the vector is again (1,
2) and the scalar is -2, then the product of the scalar
times the vector is (-2, -4), which also corresponds to
the entry-wise product as expected.

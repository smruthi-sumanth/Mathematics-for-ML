In the previous weeks, you've learned
matrices as array of numbers. A vector is a simpler way of number
one that only has one column. It turns out that vectors can be
seen as arrows in the plane or in a higher dimensional space. Two very important components
of vectors are their magnitude, namely their size and their direction. This is what you learn next. A vector is simply a couple of numbers. It could be two numbers,
three numbers anything. The number of coordinates in the vector
is the dimension of the space in which it lives. For example, the vector with
coordinates 4,3 lives in the plane and is precisely our the points at the point
with horizontal coordinate 4 and vertical coordinate 3. You can have vectors space of higher
dimensions for example in 3D. The vector with coordinates
4,3,1 lives in this space. And is the arrow pointing at
the point with coordinates 4,3 and 1 with respect to the access X, Y and Z. Vector has two very important points. The magnitude or size and
the direction which I will show you next. The magnitude, the size of the vectors
can be defined in several ways. But the great news is that all of
them emulate the distances you use in real life. The first way to measure distance. Imagine that you live in a city
with lots of buildings and blocks formed by streets that
are either horizontal or vertical. You need to go from home to the store,
but you can only go on the streets. Therefore the distance between points,
say there are four blocks horizontally and three blocks vertically between your
house and the store is the sum 4+3. This is called the taxicab distance. And no matter what route you take, you will always end up at
a distance of seven blocks. The other way you can go to
the stories to forget your car and actually hop into a helicopter. The helicopter doesn't need to
follow the streets or corners, and it can simply fly directly. The best you can do with the helicopter is
the square root of 3 squared +4 squared. Which is precisely 5. This is because of the pythagorean
theorem that states that the length of the hypothesis in a right triangle
is the square root of the sum of the squares off both sides. Now, why these distances? Because both give us ways to find the size
of the vector with coordinates a,b. The first one, the L1e norm is to find out
the taxicab distance between the origin and the point a,b. Which is precisely some of
the absolute values of b and b. Why absolute values? Because a and
Bb can be positive or negative, but the distance to walk
is always positive. The second measure of the size of
vector is the L2 norm defined by the helicopter distance between
the origin and the point a,b. As you've seen this is the square root of
the sum of the squares of the coordinates. By default, when you specify with norm
to use, we are using the L2 norm. The reason is that it's a more natural
one because precisely it is the length of the arrow. The direction of a vector can also
be deduced from its coordinates. For example, for this vector coordinates 4,3,
if the angle of the horizontal axis is theta, then the tangent of
theta is precisely three quarters. That means that theta is the arc tan or
tangent inverse of three quarters, which is 0.6 foreign radiance. Or if you prefer 36.87 degrees.

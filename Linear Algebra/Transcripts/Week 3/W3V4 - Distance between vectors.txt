The difference between
two vectors is helpful to tell how far apart two
vectors are from each other. For example, how different is vector 15 from the vector 62? One way to tell is by the L1 distance or the L1
norm of the difference. This is the sum of
the absolute values of the components,
which is eight. Another way to tell is by the L2 distance or the L2
norm of the difference, which in this case is 5.83. A final way that you haven't seen yet is
the cosine distance. This is simply the cosine of the angle between
the two vectors. In machine learning,
it' s very useful to know distances between vectors because many times
you want to calculate different similarities
between data points, and these measures
are very useful.

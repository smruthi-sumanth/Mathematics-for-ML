In this video, you will learn a very
nice and compact way to express systems of linear equations using matrices
and vectors, called the dot product. The dot product is a very important
operation in linear algebra. In fact, you've already
learned the dot product, but here you will learn it formally. This is how it works. So imagine that you have the following
problem, you buy some fruit, let's say 2 apples,
4 bananas and 1 cherry. And each apple costs $3, each banana
costs $5, and each cherry cost $2. And the question is,
how much does everything costs? So that's an easy problem, but
the point is the way to express it. The way to express the number of fruits is
using a vector which is simply a column of numbers 2, 4 and 1, that's
the amount of foods we bought of each. And the prices can also be expressed
as the vector with entries 3, 5 and 2, that's the price of each of the fruits. In order to find the price
of all the fruits, you can find the price of
each fruit individually, mainly 2 apples multiplied by 3,
which is the price of each apple, to get 2*3 = $6, that's the amount
of money you spend on apples. Then you can do the same thing for
bananas and get 4*5 = 20, and the same thing for cherries, so 1*2 = 2. So 6 is the amount of money you spend on
apples, 20 on bananas, and 2 on cherries. And the total price of
fruit is 6 + 20 + 2 = 28. Now, what you just did
was the dot product, because you can abbreviate it like this,
and that means 2.3 + 4.5 +1.2 = 28. We can actually express it like this, it's
more common to have the first vector as a row and the second vector as a column,
and then forget about the fruits and get the dot product. So dot product of the vectors 241 and 352 is the sum of each
corresponding pair of entries. And that's it, the dot product is very,
very often used in linear algebra and next you'll see some of its uses. There's a nice connection
between dot product and norm. Let's go back to the vector at
coordinates 4, 3 whose norm was 5, and notice one thing and it's that 4 square + 3 square is actually
the dot product of the vector and itself. So it's 4*4 + 3*3 = 25. And this is always the case. The L2 norm is always the square root of
the dot product between the vector and itself. And sometimes you'll see it
written in this notation, with an angle bracket on the left and
an angle bracket on the right

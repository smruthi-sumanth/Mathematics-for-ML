Welcome to week three. The main topics for
this week are vectors and matrix, and some of their properties such as
the size and direction of a vector. You will also learn many
operations you can apply on them. See in a way, vectors and
matrices are a lot like numbers. Numbers can be added,
multiplied, divided and many of these operations can be
propagated into vectors and matrices. For example, one can think of the sum of
two vectors, the product of two vectors, or the product of two matrices, or
the product of a vector and a matrix. Furthermore, just just like you can find
the multiplicative inverse of a number, for example,
the inverse of two is one half. You can also find the multiplicative
inverse of a matrix that is under some conditions that you'll see,
but actually you've seen before. You'll see throughout
the week that matrices and vectors are essential in
any kind of data set. Another very important concept you learned
this week is the concept of a linear transformation. Linear transformations are very,
very special way to visualize matrices graphically, and one that can make
many concepts much more clear. But before getting into that, here
are some applications to machine learning. Undoubtedly one of the coolest
applications from neural networks in generative learning, where the computer
doesn't just answer questions. It actually produces
things such as images. The images of human faces produced
by neural networks in particular, a special set of them called generative
adversarial neural networks are so realistic looking that
they may trick you and I into thinking they're
pictures of actual humans. The images here are perfect demonstration
of such AI generated human faces. And generative models can
also take text as input and produce images that accurately
represent the text they were given. It turns out the text-to-images
are very active area of research and machine learning and has made great
progress in the last few years. Computers are able to understand text well
enough to produce some impressive image results. In your career as a machine
learning practitioner, you'll be building these types
of ML models and for that, it is very important that you know,
their core which is manipulating matrices, vectors and their operations very well,
which is the topic of this week. So let's get started.

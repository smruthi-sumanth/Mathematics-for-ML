Just like numbers can be added and
subtracted to obtain other numbers, vectors can also be added and
subtracted to obtain other vectors. And this can be done
in a very natural way. Here it is. If you'd like to add two vectors,
for example, the vectors U with coordinates 4,1 and
V with coordinates 1,3, all you've got to do is add
the coordinates to get the vector 5,4. Now this is a nice
geometric interpretation. The sum vector is precisely diagonal in a parallelogram formed
by the vectors U and V. Something similar happens with the
difference except with the other diagonal of the parallelogram. So the difference between
the vectors 1,3 and 4,1 is also taking
component wise to be 3- 2. That is this vector over here, which doesn't look like anything special
except if you were to translate it, it matches precisely with the vector obtained
by joining the points 1,3 and 4,1.

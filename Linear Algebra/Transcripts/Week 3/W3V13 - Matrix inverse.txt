A matrix can have a very special matrix
associated with it called the inverse. When I think of the inverse of a matrix,
I think of the inverse of a number, namely the number that when multiplied to,
it gives us one. For example, the inverse of the number
two is the number one-half and the inverse of minus
five is minus one-fifth. The inverse matrix is
precisely that matrix for which the product of the matrices
is the identity matrix. In a linear transformation, the inverse matrix is the one that
undoes the job of the original matrix, namely the one that returns the plane
to where it was at the beginning. And here's how an inverse matrix works. Imagine that you have a linear
transformation corresponding to the usual matrix with entries 3, 1, 1 and 2, and that turns the square
into this parallelogram over here. Now there exist some transformation that
would turn this parallelogram back into the original square. And don't worry about the entries of
the matrix, we'll find them later. Just know that there is one and that would
mean that the composition of the two transformations is the one
corresponding to the identity matrix, the one that does nothing to the plane. It leaves it by itself. So if the inverse matrix is the one with
entries a, b, c and d, that means that when we multiply the original matrix
by the inverse, we get the identity. Now just like with numbers,
we're going to call the inverse, the original matrix elevated
to the power of -1. In the same way that you say two
to the minus one is one-half, then this matrix to the -1
is the inverse matrix. And this happens to have these entries and
you can verify that if you were to multiply the original matrix by this one,
you get the identity matrix. Now how do we find the entries
in this inverse matrix? The answer is by solving
a system of linear equations. So notice that if we take
the entries in this matrix on the left to be equal to
this counterpart on the right, then we really have
the following four dot products. Each one of these dot products
gives us some linear equation. Now you have a system of four linear
equations with four unknowns, a, b, c and d. We can use our usual methods of
elimination to solve it to get a = 2/5, b = -1/5, c = -1/5 and D = 3/5. So now here's a quiz. Find the inverse of the following matrix. If you find the task is impossible,
feel free to click on I couldn't find it. So by solving the corresponding system of
linear equations, we get the following. We get that the answers are a = 1/4, b = -1/4, c = -1/8, and d = 5/8. Now here's another quiz,
find the inverse of the following matrix. And if you find that
the task is impossible, feel free to click on
I'm reaching a dead end. And it turns out that
the inverse doesn't exist. We need to solve the following system
of linear equations a + c = 1, 2b + 2d = 0, 2a + 2c = 0 and b + d = 1. Now this is clearly a contradictions since
the first equation says a + c = 1 and the third equation says 2a + 2c = 0, but
if a + c = 1, then 2a + 2c has to be 2. It cannot be 0. So therefore this matrix
doesn't have an inverse.

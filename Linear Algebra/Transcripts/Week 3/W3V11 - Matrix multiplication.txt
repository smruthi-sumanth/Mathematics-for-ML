Previously, you've learned how to
multiply matrices and vectors. In this video, you learned how to
multiply matrices and matrices. The product formula is very intuitive, but what I really enjoy is how it
looks like for linear transformations. In short, matrix multiplication
corresponds to combining two linear transformations into a third one. Follow me and I'll show you how. So, imagine that you have
a matrix with entries 3 1 1 2, the one you've already seen. So, let's quickly take a look at
the linear transformation here. The vector 1 0 goes to 3 1,
which gets plotted here, and the vector 0 1 goes to the vector
1 2 which gets plotted here. And then the fundamental basis on the left
gets sent to this basis on the right. So let's do another one, but
let's start with the basis on the right. So, let's see what linear transformation
corresponds to the matrix 2 -1 0 2. So let's see how it acts
on the two basis vectors, which now are the vector 3 1 3 1 goes 2 5. Therefore this vector over here goes
to the point 2 5 on the right, and the other vector is (1, 2). This matrix times 1 2
becomes the vector (0, 4). So we plot 0 4. And then this parallelogram
on the left turns into this parallelogram on the right. So that is a way to see
that linear transformation. And now let's put them together. So we have the first linear transformation
corresponding to the matrix 3 1 1 2, and the second one corresponding
to the matrix 2 -1 0 2. Now, if we forget about the middle one,
then there's a linear transformation between the first and the third, and
that has to correspond to some matrix. The question is, what matrix corresponds
to that linear transformation? So, let's simplify a bit and
only look at the basis vectors. So by looking only at the left and
the right with C, that the vector (1, 0) on the left
gets sent to 5 2 on the right. Therefore as we saw before,
the first column of the matrix is 5 2. And the other basis vectors vector (0,
1) gets sent to the vector (0, 4). Therefore the second column
of the matrix is 0 4. So, the combination of the two linear
transformation gives us the linear transformation corresponding
to the matrix 5 0 2 4. Now, is there any way we can obtain
the matrix from the first to the third, from the other two matrices? And the answer is yes we can. And that's what matrix multiplication is. This operation over here is a matrix
of the left times matrix in the right equals the third matrix. Now, notice something that
the matrix got flipped. This corresponded to the first linear
transformation, the one on the left, and this corresponded to the second one. That's something very
important to keep in mind. And the reason is because the linear
transformations act on the vector on the left. So you multiply matrix times vector. Therefore, you first multiply
the matrix 3 1 1 2, and then multiply the matrix 2 -1 0 2. So they go in the opposite direction. Now, is there a fast way to see matrix
multiplication without having to draw linear transformations? The answer is yes. And you've pretty much seen it already
because there's a lot of dot products. Basically, look at the matrix on the left
as two rows of the matrix on the right as two columns. And take every possible combination of
dot products between row and columns. So, for example, the first row and the first column go in the top left
corner, and the first row of the first and the second column on the right
go in the top right corner. Now let's calculate these dot
products like we already know. The first one is 5, the second one is 0,
the third one is 2, and the fourth one is 4. So the matrix 5 0 2 4 is the product
of these other two matrices. So in summary, you can look at a matrix
product this way as multiplying two matrix, but you can also see it as
combining two linear transformations into a third linear transformation.

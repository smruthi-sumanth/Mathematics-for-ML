In this video, you
will learn how to multiply a matrix and a vector. This is also something you've
already learned as it is precisely how a system of
linear equations looks. Here's how it works. Recall from previous videos that
the dot product between two vectors
is the sum of the products of the
corresponding entries. An equation with unknown
variables such as for example 2a plus 4b plus c equals 28 can be written as the product of the row
vector with entries 2, 4, 1, and a column vector
with the unknown entries a, b, and c. So vectors
can have variables on. This represents
an equation where the unknowns in the column
vector represent the price of each of the fruits and the
number in the row vector represents the amount of
each fruit that you bought. The $28 represents the dot
product of the two vectors. Now, imagine that
you have a system of three equations
with three unknowns. Each one of these
equations can be expressed as a dot product, for example, the first one, a plus b plus c equals 10, can be expressed as the dot
product of the vector 1, 1, 1, which is the
coefficients of a, b, and c, and the vector
with the variables a, b, and c, and
that's equal to 10. The equation a plus
2b plus c equals 15, can be seen as a dot
product of 1, 2, 1, and a, b, c, and that's 15. Finally, equation
a plus b equals 2c can be seen as a dot
product of vector 1, 1, 2, and the vector a, b, c, and that's equal to 12. Now it seems clumsy to represent this with three
different dot product. Is there a nicer way? The answer is yes. First thing we do is
put them like this. On the left, we
have our system of three equations and three unknown variables
and on the right, we have three dot products. Now, notice that the
column vector is the same. So we can simply unite the three vectors
and get a matrix. Now we get the product of
a matrix and a vector. The product of a matrix
and a vector is nothing more than 3 dot products
stacked together. If you have more
equations in your system, then you have a bigger matrix. But from now on, we're going to be expressing
systems of equations as a product of a
matrix times a vector.

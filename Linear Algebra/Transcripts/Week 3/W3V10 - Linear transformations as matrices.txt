In the previous video, you learn how to turn a matrix
into a linear transformation. But going the other way
around is just as easy. Here I'll show you how to start
with linear transformation, and then find the corresponding matrix. So let's say we have
some incognito matrix and we know it sends this fundamental square
or basis into this one over here. And the goal is to find
the entries of the matrix. So let's look at where it
sent each of the points. The point 0, 0 gets sent to 0,
0 which always happens. The point 1 0 gets sent to 3,
-1 which is the bottom corner. The point 0 1 gets sent 2, -3 and
the point 1 1 gets sent to 5 2. So it turns out we don't
need that much information. We only need these two points over here. I'm going to use arrows to denote this
point since vectors tend to be denoted by an arrow growing from the origin
all the way to the point. So the vector with coordinates 1 0 gets
sent to the vector at coordinates 3, -1. And the one with coordinates 0 1 gets
sent to the one with coordinates 2 3. Now I invite you to take a piece
of paper and do the math and, convince yourself that that's
how matrix multiplication works. But the matrix that sends
the vector 1 0 and 0 1 to 3, -1 and 2 3 is precisely the one
that has columns 3, -1 and 2, 3. And so that is how you turn a linear
transformation into its corresponding matrix. You only look at where the two
fundamental vectors 1 0 and 0 1 go, and those are your columns of the matrix.

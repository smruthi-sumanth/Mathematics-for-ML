As you can imagine, the angle between two vectors
is very important. There are some nice
relations between the angle and the dot product, which I'll show
you in this video. To begin, take a look at
these two perpendicular, also called orthogonal
vectors with entries minus 1, 3 and 6, 2. Now take the dot product and
notice that the dot product is 6 times minus
1 plus 2 times 3, which is 0. This always happens. In fact, two vectors
are orthogonal if and only if the dot
product is zero. Now for a recap of
what you've seen, the dot product between
a vector and itself is precisely the norm squared or the length of
the vector squared. The dot product between
two perpendicular or orthogonal vectors
is always zero. What about the dot
product between two random vectors, u and v? Is there a nice
way to write this? It turns out that there is. Let's look at it from a
slightly different way. You saw the dot product of a vector and itself is the norm squared over the product
of the norm and itself. The dot product
between a vector and a longer vector in the same
direction is very similar. It's simply the product
of the two norms, norm of u times norm of v. Now what are the vectors
have an angle in between. It's almost the same
except you have to perpendicular project one
vector onto the other one, is precisely the shade that one vector leaves
on the other one. This vector is u prime, then the dot product to
u and v is the product of the magnitude of u prime and the magnitude of
v. The interesting things that it
doesn't matter if you project u to v
or v to u, you still get the
same dot product. An easier way to
see this is this, the angle between the
vectors is Theta, then the dot product
of u and v is the magnitude of u
times the magnitude of v times the
cosine of the angle. Using what you know
about the dot product, you cannot tell if the
dot product between two vectors is positive,
negative, or zero. For example take a look
at the vector 6, 2. A vector perpendicular to it, such as minus 1, 3 has dot product of 0
with the vector 6, 2. A vector to the right
if it's such as 2, 4 for example, has a dot product of
20, which is positive. A vector to the left of
it, such as minus 4, 1 has a dot product of negative
22, which is negative. Now, why is the dot product
with 2, 4 positive? Well, the reason is because the projection of
this vector onto 6, 2 has positive length, and why is the dot-product
with negative 4, 1 negative? The reason is because the
projection onto the vector 6, 2 is negative because
you have to go in the opposite direction
of the vector 6, 2. Therefore, the sign of the
dot product of a vector corresponds to being
on one side or the other one off that
perpendicular vector. In other words, this
happens in general. The vector is u, then the
vector that haven't dot product of 0 with u are all the
perpendicular vectors to u. The vectors that have a positive dot product with u are all the vectors
in this region, and the vector that have a
negative dot product with u are the vectors in
this region over here.

When I think of numbers and
multiplication, I think of the number 1
as a very special number. See 1 is special because when
you multiply any number by 1 you get the same number you started with. The identity matrix satisfies this
exact same role among the matrices. The identity matrix is
the matrix that when multiplied by any other matrix it
gives the same matrix and its corresponding linear
transformation is very simple. It is the one that
leaves the plane intact. Here's how it looks. >> The identity matrix
has a very simple look. It has 1s in the diagonal and
0's everywhere else. And why does it work? Because when you multiply it by any
vector, say of entries a, b, c, d and e you can verify that the resulting
vector is also the one with entries a, b, c, d and e. I encourage you to verify
this with pen and paper. For example,
the first entry is calculated as follows. The dot product between the first row and
the vector, which you can check that it's a. And the identity matrix and
linear transformation is very simple, as it sends each point
precisely to itself. As you can see this metric
sends the vector 0,0 to 0,0, the vector 1,0 to 1,0, etc. And that's why it's called
the identity matrix.

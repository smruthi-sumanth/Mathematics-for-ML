In the last video,
you learn how to find matrice inverses and also that some matrices have no inverse. What is the rule then for
a matrix to have an inverse or not? You will be happy to find that the rule
is something you've already learned. See, matrices behave a lot like numbers. You just realize that some matrices have
multiplicative inverses in the same way that some numbers have
multiplicative inverses. For example,
the inverse of 5 is one fifth, or 0.2. The inverse of 8 is 1 eighth, or 0.125. However, not all numbers have
multiplicative inverses. For example, what is the Inverse of 0? The inverse of zero is not
defined as there is no number, which when multiplied
by zero gives us one. Now from the last video
in the previous quizzes, you know that this is also
the case with matrices. Some matrices have inverse is
like this two over here, and some don't like this one over here. So what is special about
these three matrices? Can you look at something special? Well, as you've seen before,
the first two are non-singular and the third one is singular. Could it be that this is a requirement and you'll be happy to say this
is exactly the requirement. Non-singular matrix
always have an inverse. And that's why we also call
them invertible matrix and singular matrix never have an inverse,
which is what we call them non-invertible. And something interesting happens
when you look at the determinant, the determinant is non-zero for a invertible matrices in the same way
that non-zero numbers have an inverse. And the determinant is zero for
non-invertible matrices in the same way that zero doesn't have
a multiplicative inverse. So I like to remember that way. Non-zero determinants mean that
the matrix has an inverse and a zero determinant,
that the matrix does not have an inverse.

In the previous videos you have seen
matrices as arrays of numbers that represent systems of linear equations. But there is another very powerful and
very useful representation of matrix and it is as linear transformations. A linear transformation is a way to send
each point in the plane into another point in the plane in a very structured way. Here, I show you how. In this video you'll see an illustration
of how matrix is a linear transformation in two dimensions, but I invite you
to imagine it in more dimensions, such as a three dimensional space for
example. Say you have this two by two
matrix with entries 311 and 2. So here's the linear
transformation it corresponds to. First consider two planes
with access labeled a and b. The transformation will send every point
on the plane in the left to a point in the plane in the right
in the following way. Any point has two coordinates. Those two coordinates
form a column vector. To get the vector in the right,
we multiply the first vector by the matrix and whatever you
get is the point in the right. So this will be easier with some examples. First, let's look at
the point in the origin. The 0 0 that becomes the vector 0 0, which we multiplied by the matrix,
we get the vector 0 0. So 00 goes to 00. This actually always happens
with linear transformation. The origin gets sent to the origin. Now let's look at the point 1 0. So the matrix times the vector
1 0 gives us a vector 3 1. So 1 0 goes to 3 1. Now let's look at 0 1. The matrix times 0 1 is equal to 1 2. So 0 1 goes to 1 2. And finally let's look at 1 1. Matrix times the vector 1 1 is
the vector 4 3, so 1 1 goes to 4 3. And actually this defines
the entire transformation. So let's look at this little square
form that these four points. It goes to this parallelogram. The square on the left is called a basis. And so
is the parallelogram on their right. And they're very,
very important concepts in linear algebra. And you'll know why they're
called basis in a little bit and a very special property that basis have
is that they cover the entire plane. So actually, since this square
actually tessalates the whole plane and the parallelogram tessalates
the whole plane as well. Then the linear transformation is simply
defined as a change of coordinates. So for example, if we want to
find where the point minus 2, 3 goes well, the point minus 2,
3 on the left is obtained by starting at the origin walking two blocks
to the left and three blocks up. So to find where that point goes in the
linear transformation we simply started the origin and
walk two blocks to the left and three blocks up in these new coordinates. And we get the point minus 3, 4. And so the matrix times vector minus 2,
3 is the vector minus 3, 4. In the language of buying apples and
bananas. I like to see transformations
in the following way. Let's say that you go to the store on
the first day you buy three apples and one banana. And on the second day you buy
one apple and two bananas. So if the price of apples is a and
the price of bananas in b. Then the resulting prices for days one and
two are the entries of the vector corresponding to the product of
these matrix with entries 3 1 1 2. And the vector a b. The linear transformation takes you from
a point in the left where the axis are the price of an apple and the price
of a banana to a point in the right, where the axis are the price
you paid on the first day and the price you paid on the second day. So the apples are $1 and
the banana are also $1. Then the first day you paid $4 and the second day you paid three does a
linear transformation of the matrix sends the point with coordinates 1 1 to
the point with coordinates 4 3. The change of coordinates then
is the price of apples and bananas to the price of the first day and
the second day.
